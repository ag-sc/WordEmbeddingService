Lack of a sufficient downwind buffer distance between the kiter and hard objects has contributed to accidents reducing the available distance and time for reaction
 Kitesurfers will determine the wind strength using either an anemometer or, more typically, visual clues as shown in the Beaufort scale
Wind strength and kite sizes
 Offshore winds pose the danger of being blown away from the shore in the event of equipment failure or loss of control
 The kite is then piloted from overhead to the direction of travel
 From 2001 onwards, twin-tip bi-directional boards became more popular for most flat water riders, with directional boards still in use for surf conditions
 Rear hand grabs are known as "Crail", "Indy","Nuke", "Tindy", "Tail", "Tailfish", and "Stalefish"; while front hand grabs are known as "Slob", "Mute", "Seatbelt", "Melan", "Method", and "Nose"
 This applies regardless of whether kiters are on the same, or opposing courses
 In general, however, most kiteboarders only need one board and one to three kites (7-12 sq m in size)
Advances in hybrid and bow kite designs leads to a better ability to control the power that they provide and effective safety release systems
 Previously the record was held only by sailboats or windsurfers
 Kite buggying proved to be very popular worldwide, with over 14,000 buggies sold up to 1999.
Controlled flying and jumping
 In 1995, Cory Roeseler visited Peter Lynn at New Zealand's Lake Clearwater in the Ashburton Alpine Lakes area, demonstrating speed, balance and upwind angle on his 'ski'
 As the kite begins to lift, the board edge is then 'released' and the rider becomes airborne
In 1997, specialized kite boards were developed by Raphaël Salles and Laurent Ness
 Paying attention to the weather and staying within the limits of the riders ability will provide the safest experience
In 1990, practical kite buggying was pioneered by Peter Lynn at Argyle Park in Ashburton, New Zealand
Louis Tapper completed the longest recorded kite journey, completing 2000 km between Salvador and Sao Luis, Brazil
On the 14th of November 2009, Alex Caizergues completed another run of 50.98 knots in Namibia
 As the turn ends, the kite is flown over to be in front of the surfer again
Power kites are powerful enough to pull the rider like a boat in wakeboarding and to lift their users to diving heights
In the 1800s, George Pocock used kites of increased size to propel carts on land and ships on the water, using a four-line control system—the same system in common use today
 In simple terms, this means "keep right" with the kiter coming in the opposite direction passing on the left
In 1997, the Legaignoux brothers developed and sold the breakthrough "Wipika" kite design which had a structure of preformed inflatable tubes and a simple bridle system to the wingtips, both of which greatly assisted water re-launch
 The KiteSki was commercially available in 1994. The kite had a rudimentary water launch capability and could go upwind
In 1996, Laird Hamilton and Manu Bertin were instrumental in demonstrating and popularising kitesurfing off the Hawaiian coast of Maui while in Florida Raphaël Baruch experimented riding windsurfing boards with various foil kites and changing the name of the sport from flysurfing to kitesurfing
 These kites can be fully depowered, which is a significant safety feature
 A kite can get out of control after the rider falling or in a sudden wind gust, which can happen more frequently due to excessively strong winds from squalls or storms ("collard")
Controlled flying is possible and is one of the biggest attractions of the sport
 On 4 October, Alex Caizergues (also of France) broke this record with a 50.57 knots run
There are different styles of kiteboarding, including freestyle, freeride, downwinders, speed, course racing, wakestyle, jumping and kitesurfing in the waves
 Each grab has a different name dependent on which part of the board is grabbed and with which hand it is grabbed by
 A rider must also have a clear safety zone of 30m upwind to jump as his lines could touch the kite or the lines of another rider kiteboarding close by (see Kite High rule)
 LEIs are the most popular choice among kitesurfers thanks to their quicker and more direct response to the rider's inputs, easy relaunchability if crashed into the water and resilient nature
In 2006, second generation flat LEI kites were developed which combine near total depower and easy, safe relaunch with higher performance, no performance penalties and reduced bar pressure
Kiteboarding can pose hazards to surfers, beachgoers, bystanders and others on the water
 To consider and coordinate submissions from the sub-committees
Wind speed, rider experience and weight, board size, kite design and riding style are all interdependent and affect the choice of kite
A number of grabs can also be combined into one trick
 If an LEI kite hits the water or ground too hard or is subjected to substantial wave activity, bladders can burst or it can be torn apart
The previous longest recorded kite journey was by Eric Gramond who completed a 13-day trip of 1450 km along the coast of Brazil
 Kites come in a variety of designs
 Similar speeds are reached by windsurfers in the same location by Anders Bringdal and Antoine Albeau, respectively 50.46 and 50.59 knots
Some countries have laws about flying kites and being safe while flying that may also apply to kitesurfing
 Similarly, the downwind kiter must keep their kite low to avoid their lines crossing upwind kites
French kitesurfer Sébastien Cattelan became the first sailor to break the 50 knots barrier by reaching 50.26 knots on 3 October 2008 at the Lüderitz Speed Challenge in Namibia
 A typical kite quiver might include 8 m², 10 m² and 12 m² traditional "C-kites"
 Bruno Legaignoux has continued to improve kite designs, including developing the bow kite design, which has been licensed to many kite manufacturers
Starboard Rule When kiters approach from opposite directions the kiter who has the wind on the starboard (right side, right leg/arm leads in direction of travel) has right of way
 By the end of 1998 kitesurfing had become an extreme sport, distributed and taught through a handful group of shops and schools worldwide
 Many of the manufacturers are on their third or fourth generation of kites
 The first competition was held on Maui in September 1998 and won by Flash Austin
 Lack of weather awareness and understanding figures in many of these cases, but avoiding weather problems is possible Choice of inappropriate locations for kiteboarding where the wind passes over land creating wind shadow, rotor with pronounced gusts and lulls has also factored in many accidents
An experienced rider generally carries a 'quiver' of different sized kites appropriate for the wind speed range
Some kite designs from late 2005 and onwards have included immediate and almost full depower integrated with the control bar and improved quick release mechanisms, both of which are making the sport much safer
 A Executive Committee is on a regular basis re-appointed by the class AGM
Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Dieter Strasilla from Germany developed parachute-skiing and later perfected a kiteskiing system using self made paragliders and a ball-socket swivel allowing the pilot to sail upwind and uphill but also to take off into the air at will
 The intention was to establish kitepower as an alternative to horsepower, partly to avoid the hated "horse tax" that was levied at that time
 Some kites are more rectangular in shape; others have more tapered ends; each design determines the kite's flying characteristics
 Many problems and dangers that may be encountered while learning kiting can be avoided or minimized by taking professional instruction through lesson centres
 Kite power is also directly linked to speed, and smaller kites can be flown faster in stronger winds
 The duties and responsibilities of the Executive Committee are: to take care of the day-to-day business of the association
 Exact kite sizes will vary depending on rider weight and desired wind ranges
 High aspect ratios (ribbon-like kites) develop more power in lower wind speeds
 The ability to adjust the angle of attack also makes them easier to re-launch when lying front first on the water
The development of modern-day kitesurfing by the Roeselers in the USA and the Legaignoux in France carried on in parallel to buggying
 Douglas also became the world's third over-50 knots sailor,
Leading edge inflatables
A poorly executed turn will "fly" the surfer, and is often followed by a tumble if the surfer can't put the board down at the right angle
 Bill Roeseler, a Boeing aerodynamicist, and his son Cory Roeseler patented the "KiteSki" system which consisted of water skis powered by a two line delta style kite controlled via a bar mounted combined winch/brake
 By using depower, the kite's angle of attack to the wind is reduced, thereby catching less wind in the kite and reducing the power or pull
Open cell foils rely on a constant airflow against the inlet valves to stay inflated, but are generally impossible to relaunch if they hit the water, because they have no means of avoiding deflation, and quickly become soaked
Board grabs are tricks performed while a rider is jumping or has gained air from popping by grabbing the board in a number of positions with either hand
 The direction of the kite is then reversed, which swings the surfer's path in a semi circle, centered on the kite
 Kites have become lighter, more durable, much easier to launch and safer
 One of his patents describes in 1979 the first use of an inflatable kite design for kitesurfing
Between 2009 and 2013 kite technology has continued to grow
In 2008, Naish introduced another kite design, with their "Sigma Series" of kites
 In 1903, aviation pioneer Samuel Cody developed "man-lifting kites" and succeeded in crossing the English Channel in a small collapsible canvas boat powered by a kite
The International Kiteboarding Association (IKA) is an International Class Association of the International Sailing Federation (ISAF)
Solo kiteboarding has been a frequent contributing cause to accidents; kiteboarders should try to kite with friends and keep an eye on one another
Kitesurfing is a style of kiteboarding specific to wave riding, which utilizes standard surfboards or boards shaped specifically for the purpose
 Before jumping, the surfer builds up tension in the lines by strongly edging the board
Kitesurfing safety rules
 Marine hazards include sharks, jellyfish, sea otters, dolphins, and even crocodiles, depending on the location
 Most LEI kite manufacturers developed a variation of the bow kite by 2006.
 The patent covers, specifically, a water sport using a floating board of a surf board type where a pilot standing up on it is pulled by a wind catching device of a parachute type tied to his harness on a trapeze type belt
Weather forecasting and awareness is the principal factor to safe kiteboarding
 The kiter who has the wind on the port side (left side, left leg/arm are leads in direction of travel) shall keep out of the way of the other
 Both carts and boats were able to turn and sail upwind
 The ISAF mid-year meeting of May 2013 proposed seeking an eleventh medal to include kitesurfing in 2020 at the same time there was a commitment made to retain the existing other 10 classes as they are for 2020 and even 2024 including the RSX windsurfer for men and women
 Since kiteboarding relies heavily on favorable, consistent wind conditions, certain locations tend to become popular and sought out by kiteboarders
 On 30 missions, there was no fatalities but five injuries: two had bone fractures after being hit by their boards, two others were suffering from critical hypothermia and exhaustion and the fifth was exhausted and lacerated
Several different kitesurfing styles are evolving, some of which cross over
Jumping can be very risky, riders must keep a clear buffer zone downwind when attempting to jump
 The delta-kites are growing in popularity since 2008 with around 12 companies offering delta-kites since 2008/2009.
 This trip is also the longest solo journey, completed without support crew, using one kite and a 35-litre backpack
 An example for a closed cell kite is the Arc Kite
 The global market for kite gear sales is worth US$321 million
 Manufacturers have continued to add new safety features
 Collisions with wind surfers, other kite boarders or water craft are hazards, particularly at busy locations
In October 1977 Gijsbertus Adrianus Panhuise (Netherlands) received the first patent for KiteSurfing
There are also national and regional kitesurfing associations in many countries
Foil kites are designed with either an open or closed cell configuration
 The Executive Committee elected amongst themselves: - Chairman: Richard Gowers (GBR) - Vice-chairman: Bruno De Wannemaeker (BEL) - Executive Secretary: Markus Schwendtner (GER) - Board members: Mirco Babini (ITA), Olivier Mouragues (FRA), Adam Szymanski (POL) and John Gomes (USA)
Cross-shore and cross-onshore winds are the best for kiteboarding
In USA around 2003, the fatality rate with 6 to 12 for 100'000 participants was higher than 4 to 5 in SCUBA diving (and much higher than the two Walkers), comparable to the 15 in Motor Vehicle Traffic, and much lower than all accidents with 56 or the 88 Paragliders
 105 accidents were reported in the Kiteboarding Safety Information Database between 2000 and September 2003, with 14 fatalities
 Adequate quality professional kiteboarding training, careful development of experience and consistent use of good judgement and safety gear should result in fewer problems in kiteboarding
 Kitesurfing schools provide courses and lessons to teach skills including kite launching, flying, landing, usage of the bar, lines and safety devices
Seasoned kiteboarders will likely have three or more kite sizes which are needed to accommodate various wind levels, although bow kites may change this, as they present an enormous wind range; some advanced kiters use only one bow kite
 A rider may perform a "tail grab going to indy" by moving the rear hand from the back of the board to the middle of the toe side edge
In May 2012, the course racing style of kitesurfing was announced as a sport for the 2016 Rio Olympics, replacing windsurfing
 But a kite could become uncontrolled and that situation can be very dangerous; especially within a difficult environment
 They can also cover a wider wind range than a comparable C-shaped kite
 The kite size—wind speed curve tapers off, so going to a larger kite to reach lower wind ranges becomes futile at a wind speed of around eight knots
 These features allow the kite's angle of attack to be altered more and thus adjust the amount of power being generated to a much greater degree than previous LEIs
 A large variety of maneuvers and tricks can be performed while jumping
when on 8 September he made a 50.54 knots (93.60 km/h) run
 This has resulted in a growing number of new riders, both younger and older
A careless turn in high winds can easily swing the rider into the air and result in an uncontrolled impact
 In South Africa between October 2003 and April 2004, 83% of search & rescue missions involving kitesurf were in offshore winds with the kite still attached to the harness, uncontrolled in strong winds or impossible to relaunch in weak winds
 However, lack of sufficient practice of emergency depowering the kite and going out in excessively strong or unstable weather can reduce the benefit of high depower kites
Starting in 1999, kitesurfing became a mainstream sport with the entry of key windsurfing manufacturers namely Naish and Neil Pryde
 Direct onshore winds carry the risk of being thrown onto land, and are thus less favorable
 Water relaunches with closed cell foil kites are simpler; a steady tug on the power lines typically allows them to take off again
 These kites are a SLE design and feature a unique "bird in flight" shape with the center of the kite swept back to put much of the sail area behind the tow point, which Naish claims has multiple benefits
 Most kitesurfing takes place along ocean shores, usually off beaches, but it can also be practiced on large lakes and inlets and occasionally on rivers
In sailing terms, a sailor or kiter with right of way is entitled to "insist" on exercising that right (warning opposing kiters) by shouting "starboard" very clearly and in good time
Kites come in sizes ranging from 0.7 square meters to 21 square meters, or even larger
 'Aspect ratio' is the ratio of span to length
 Sébastien Cattelan became the record holder of France and Europe with 55.49 and was the first rider to reach 55 knots
 Bow kites are popular with riders from beginner to advanced levels
 It's important to also consider potential hazards downwind and crosswind of the rider such as people, buildings, trees and other fixed obstacles
, the number of kitesurfers was estimated by the ISAF and IKA at 1.5 million persons worldwide (pending review)
 There are more than thirty companies manufacturing Leading edge inflatable kites
 In 2013, there are at least 20 "major" kite manufacturers, each with multiple models available
Kite High Rule - A kiter who is upwind (closest to the wind) must keep their kite high to avoid their lines crossing those of downwind kiters
Two brothers, Bruno Legaignoux and Dominique Legaignoux, from the Atlantic coast of France, developed kites for kitesurfing in the late 1970s and early 1980s and patented an inflatable kite design in November 1984, a design that has been used by companies to develop their own products
In 2009, the performance revolution shows no sign of slowing
 In general, the larger the surface area, the more power the kite has
 Smaller kites are used by light riders, or in strong wind conditions; larger kites are used by heavier riders or in light wind conditions
Early bow kites had some disadvantages compared to classic LEI kites:
Other boating rules such as no-go zones, distance from shore and swimmers also apply
 Offshore winds are suitable in a lake or when a safety boat is available, however they are generally more gusty
 A 'heel turn jibe' is a quicker,and more skillful turn that is executed by slowing down, flattening the board, then reversing the board flat on the water by bringing the rear foot around downwind to eventually become the new leading foot
 These speeds are verified, but are still subject to ratification by the World Sailing Speed Record Council
A beginner can turn by stopping or sinking backwards into the water,and then turning the kite in the opposite direction and starting again
 A kitesurfer can get farther from shore than an easy swim, which is the primary reason kitesurfing in directly offshore winds is discouraged
 The inflated bladders give the kite its shape and also keep the kite floating once dropped in the water
It is possible to be seriously injured after being lofted, dragged, carried off, blown downwind or dashed, resulting in a collision with hard objects including sand, buildings, terrain or power lines or even by hitting the water surface with sufficient speed or height ("kitemare", a portmanteau of kite and nightmare)
 Called Hybrid or SLE kites (Supported Leading Edge), these kites are suitable for both beginners and experts
 A safety knife is useful if lines become tangled and dangerous
Clearance Rule - A kiter while jumping must have a clear safety zone of at least 50m downwind because they will move downwind during the jump
 Although this patent did not result in any commercial interest, Gijsbertus Adrianus Panhuise could be considered as the originator of KiteSurfing
A power kite is available in two major forms: leading edge inflatables and foil kites
October 2010, Rob Douglas became the outright record holder for the short distance 500 meters with 55.65 knots
 Drowning has been a factor in severe accidents as well and may have been avoided in some cases through the use of an appropriate flotation aid or impact vest and development of acceptable swimming skills
 Foil kites have the advantage of not needing to have bladders manually inflated, a process which, with an LEI, can take up to ten minutes
 Kitesurfing storm fronts can be particularly dangerous due to rapid changes in wind strength and direction
Kiteboarding is a surface water sport combining aspects of wakeboarding, windsurfing, surfing, paragliding, and gymnastics into one extreme sport
 Then the kite is flown quickly to an overhead position, sometimes just as the surfer goes over a wave
 Its responsibility, amongst others, is to manage the global administration of the sport and combining world events into one united ranking
Through the 1980s, there were occasionally successful attempts to combine kites with canoes, ice skates, snow skis, water skis and roller skates
In the late 1970s, the development of Kevlar then Spectra flying lines and more controllable kites with improved efficiency contributed to practical kite traction
 Strasilla and his Swiss friend Andrea Kuhn used this invention also in combination with surfboards and snowboards, grasskies and selfmade buggies
Kitesurfers change kite size and/or line length depending on wind strength—stronger winds call for a smaller kite to prevent overpower situations
 Earlier in the event, on 19 September, American Rob Douglas reached 49.84 knots (92.30 km/h), becoming the first kitesurfer to establish an outright world record in speed sailing
Any location with consistent, steady side-onshore winds (10 to 35+ knots), large open bodies of water and good launch areas is suitable for kitesurfing
 Lynn coupled a three-wheeled buggy with a forerunner of the modern parafoil kite
Kitesurfing is soon to be named as an official event at the 2018 Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires
Kiters are also considered as sailing vessels – so some standard sailing rules apply such as:
 The kites could be flown for sustained periods
Foil kites are also mostly fabric (ripstop nylon) with air pockets (air cells) to provide it with lift and a fixed bridle to maintain the kite's arc-shape, similar to a paraglider
Leading edge inflatable kites, known also as inflatables, LEI kites, are typically made from ripstop polyester with an inflatable plastic bladder that spans the front edge of the kite with separate smaller bladders that are perpendicular to the main bladder to form the chord or foil of the kite
Transatlantic crossing
 Bridled designs feel more like C kites, and five-line hybrids have better depower capability than ever before
 Jumping and being airborne at inappropriate places such as shallow water or near fixed or floating objects can be hazardous
In 2005, Bow kites (also known as flat LEI kites) were developed with features including a concave trailing edge, a shallower arc in planform, and frequently a bridle along the leading edge
 In the late 1990s, Cory's ski evolved to a single board similar to a surfboard
Closed cell foils are almost identical to open cell foils except they are equipped with inlet valves to hold air in the chambers, thus keeping the kite inflated (or, at least, making the deflation extremely slow) even once in the water
A team of six kitesurfers, Filippo van Hellenberg Hubar, Eric Pequeno, Max Blom, Camilla Ringvold, Ike Frans, and Dennis Gijsbers crossed the Atlantic ocean, from the Canary islands to the Turks and Caicos Islands a distance of about, from November 20, 2013, to December 17, 2013. Each of the six spent four hours each day surfing, broken into two sessions of two hours each, one during the day, and the other during the night
All modern kites dedicated to kitesurfing provide a "depower" option to reduce the power in the kite
 Larger and smaller kiteboards have the same effect: with more available power a given rider can ride a smaller board
Accidents can generate serious injuries or even be deadly
 Names generally originate from other board sports like skateboarding and snowboarding
 However, after a vote by the General Assembly of ISAF in November 2012 (in Dun Laoghaire, Ireland) the RSX windsurfer was reinstated for both Men and Women this was an unprecedented decision when the constituent members of ISAF overthrew a decision made by the ISAF Council Kitesurfing remains therefore a non-Olympic sport until 2020 at the earliest
 Single direction boards derived from windsurfing and surfing designs became the dominant form of kiteboard
 In 1978, Ian Day's "FlexiFoil" kite-powered Tornado catamaran exceeded 40 km/h
 The journey was completed between July/August 2010 and took over 24 days of kitesurfing
 A kiteboarder harnesses the power of the wind with a large controllable power kite to be propelled across the water on a kiteboard similar to a wakeboard or a small surfboard, with or without footstraps or bindings
Bow kites have a wider wind range than C-kites, so two kite sizes (such as 7 m² and 12 m²) could form an effective quiver for winds ranging from 10 to 30+ knots for a 75 kg (165 lbs) rider
 He energetically pressed the Panama prosecution, so much so that he was accused of having put wrongful pressure on the wife of one of the defendants in order to procure evidence
 He became prefect of police in November 1887, at the critical moment of Jules Grévy's resignation from the presidency
 His ideas influenced the Radical Party regarding a wide range of issues
Bourgeois was born in Paris, and was trained in law
Following World War I, he became President of the Council of the League of Nations and won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 1920.
 In the following year he entered the Chamber, being elected deputy for the Marne, in opposition to General Boulanger, and joined the Radical Left
 He was an eminent Freemason and eight of his cabinet members were Freemasons
A social republican, Leon Bourgeois sought a middle ground between socialism and capitalism which he termed “solidarism,” where the better off had a social debt to the poor which they should pay by the income tax, thus providing the state with the necessary revenue to finance social measures for those living in poverty
 He promoted progressive taxation such as progressive income taxes and social insurance schemes, along with economic equality, expanded educational opportunities, and cooperative solidarism
 He was under-secretary for home affairs in Charles Floquet's ministry of 1888, and resigned with it in 1889, being then returned to the chamber for Reims
 In 1902 and 1903, he was elected president of the Chamber
 In 1905, he replaced the duc d'Audiffret-Pasquier as senator for the department of Marne, and in May 1906 became Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Sarrien cabinet
 However, the public was indifferent and the Senate triumphed
 As Minister of Public Instruction in the Brisson cabinet of 1898 he organized courses for adults in primary education
 In foreign policy, he called for a strong League of Nations, and the maintenance of peace through compulsory arbitration, controlled disarmament, economic sanctions, and perhaps an international military force
The Bourgeois ministry seemed to think that popular opinion would enable them to override what they regarded as an unconstitutional action on the part of the upper house
Léon Victor Auguste Bourgeois (; 21 May 185129 September 1925) was a French statesman
 He was delegate to both Hague Conferences held on 1899 and 1907. Bourgeois also became delegate to Paris Peace Conference and strongly supported the Japanese Racial Equality Proposal as "an indisputable principle of justice"
 After holding a subordinate office (1876) in the department of public works, he became successively prefect of the Tarn (1882) and the Haute-Garonne (1885), and then returned to Paris to enter the Ministry of the Interior
He retained his office in Émile Loubet's cabinet in 1892, and was Minister of Justice under Alexandre Ribot at the end of that year, when the Panama scandals were making the office one of peculiar difficulty
 After this short ministry he represented his country with dignity and effect at the Hague Peace Convention, and in 1903 was nominated a member of the permanent court of arbitration
 In the Pierre Tirard's ministry, which succeeded, he was Minister of the Interior, and subsequently, on 18 March 1890, Minister of Public Instruction in the cabinet of Freycinet, a post for which he had qualified himself by the attention he had given to educational matters
 The blow damaged Bourgeois's career as an "homme de gouvernement"
In November 1895, he formed his own cabinet, distinctively radical, which fell as the result of a constitutional crisis arising from the persistent refusal of the Senate to vote supply
 However, the Senate opposed his proposal and opposition grew until his resignation as prime minister
 To meet the charge, he resigned in March 1893 but again took office and retired only with the rest of the Freycinet ministry
 He was responsible for the direction of French diplomacy in the conference at Algeciras
 In this capacity, he was responsible for some important reforms in secondary education in 1890.
He held somewhat aloof from the political struggles of the Waldeck-Rousseau and Combes ministries, travelling considerably in foreign countries
RADIUS facilitates this by the use of "realms", which identify where the RADIUS server should forward the AAA requests for processing
Diameter uses SCTP or TCP while RADIUS typically uses UDP as the transport layer
Although realms often resemble domains, it is important to note that realms are in fact arbitrary text and need not contain real domain names
 RADIUS is used elsewhere
 Features can vary, but most can look up the users in text files, LDAP servers, various databases, etc
 While both are Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) protocols, the use-cases for the two protocols have since diverged
 More generally, some roaming partners establish a secure tunnel between the RADIUS servers to ensure that users' credentials cannot be intercepted while being proxied across the internet
Once the client has obtained such information, it may choose to authenticate using RADIUS
RADIUS Codes (decimal) are assigned as follows:
com could be a valid username with two realms
 In addition, the proxying server can be configured to add, remove or rewrite AAA requests when they are proxied over time again
 Network access servers, the gateways that control access to a network, usually contain a RADIUS client component that communicates with the RADIUS server
Authorization attributes are conveyed to the NAS stipulating terms of access to be granted
 VSA definitions from many other companies remain proprietary and/or ad-hoc, nonetheless many VSA dictionaries can be found by downloading the source code of open source RADIUS implementations, for example FreeRADIUS or openRADIUS
When network access is granted to the user by the NAS, an "Accounting Start" (a RADIUS Accounting Request packet containing an Acct-Status-Type attribute with the value "start") is sent by the NAS to the RADIUS server to signal the start of the user's network access
RADIUS is a client/server protocol that runs in the application layer, using UDP as transport
Realms can also be compounded using both prefix and postfix notation, to allow for complicated roaming scenarios; for example, somedomain
Attribute value pairs
 Accounting records can be written to text files, various databases, forwarded to external servers, etc
The RADIUS packet data format is shown to the right
RADIUS servers is an AAA protocol which manage network access in the following two-step process, also known as an "AAA transaction"
The Length field indicates the length of the entire RADIUS packet including the Code, Identifier, Length, Authenticator and optional Attribute fields
 RADIUS was developed by Livingston Enterprises, Inc
This request includes access credentials, typically in the form of username and password or security certificate provided by the user
When a client is configured to use RADIUS, any user of the client presents authentication information to the client
 As of 2012, RADIUS can also use TCP as the transport layer with TLS for security
Now, several commercial and open-source RADIUS servers exist
 Realm formats are standardized in RFC 4282, which defines a Network Access Identifier (NAI) in the form of 'user@realm'
Vendor-specific attributes
Roaming with RADIUS exposes the users to various security and privacy concerns
Because of the broad support and the ubiquitous nature of the RADIUS protocol, it is often used by ISPs and enterprises to manage access to the Internet or internal networks, wireless networks, and integrated e-mail services
The RADIUS server checks that the information is correct using authentication schemes such as PAP, CHAP or EAP
Modern RADIUS servers allow any character to be used as a realm delimiter, although in practice '@' and '\' are usually used
 RADIUS is often the back-end of choice for 802.1X authentication as well
 AAA stands for authentication, authorization and accounting
 Merit Network awarded the contract to Livingston Enterprises that delivered their PortMaster series of Network Access Servers and the initial RADIUS server to Merit
 "Start" records typically contain the user's identification, network address, point of attachment and a unique session identifier
 When a password is present, it is hidden using a method based on the RSA Message Digest Algorithm MD5.
Periodically, "Interim Update" records (a RADIUS Accounting Request packet containing an Acct-Status-Type attribute with the value "interim-update") may be sent by the NAS to the RADIUS server, to update it on the status of an active session
 As this particular implementation provides only weak protection of the user's credentials, additional protection, such as IPsec tunnels or physically secured data-center networks, should be used to further protect the RADIUS traffic between the NAS device and the RADIUS server
 Additionally, the user's security credentials are the only part protected by RADIUS itself, yet other user-specific attributes such as tunnel-group IDs or vlan memberships passed over RADIUS may be considered sensitive (helpful to an attacker) or private (sufficient to identify the individual client) information as well
The user or machine sends a request to a Network Access Server (NAS) to gain access to a particular network resource using access credentials
In turn, the NAS sends a RADIUS "Access Request" message to the RADIUS server, requesting authorization to grant access via the RADIUS protocol
 Historically, RADIUS servers checked the user's information against a locally stored flat file database
 To do so, the client creates an "Access- Request" containing such Attributes as the user's name, the user's password, the ID of the client and the Port ID which the user is accessing
 Microsoft has published some of their VSAs
 Alternatively, the user might use a link framing protocol such as the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), which has authentication packets which carry this information
A realm is commonly appended to a user's user name and delimited with an '@' sign, resembling an email address domain name
 This is known as "postfix" notation for the realm
Authentication and authorization
Finally, when the user's network access is closed, the NAS issues a final "Accounting Stop" record (a RADIUS Accounting Request packet containing an Acct-Status-Type attribute with the value "stop") to the RADIUS server, providing information on the final usage in terms of time, packets transferred, data transferred, reason for disconnect and other information related to the user's network access
 These networks may incorporate modems, DSL, access points, VPNs, network ports, web servers, etc
The Diameter protocol was intended as the replacement for RADIUS
The RADIUS server is usually a background process running on a UNIX or Microsoft Windows server
 Another common usage is "prefix" notation, which involves prepending the realm to the username and using '\' as a delimiter
 However, this practice is not always followed
 If the realm is known, the server will then "proxy" the request to the configured home server for that domain
 The RadSec protocol claims to solve aforementioned security issues
 Authentication and authorization characteristics in RADIUS are described in RFC 2865 while accounting is described by RFC 2866.
 "Interim" records typically convey the current session duration and information on current data usage
 Modern RADIUS servers can do this, or can refer to external sources — commonly SQL, Kerberos, LDAP, or Active Directory servers — to verify the user's credentials
Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking protocol that provides centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) management for users who connect and use a network service
The RADIUS server then returns one of three responses to the NAS: 1) Access Reject, 2) Access Challenge, or 3) Access Accept
 This is a concern as the MD5 hash built into RADIUS is considered insecure
 The user's proof of identification is verified, along with, optionally, other information related to the request, such as the user's network address or phone number, account status, and specific network service access privileges
The primary purpose of this data is that the user can be billed accordingly; the data is also commonly used for statistical purposes and for general network monitoring
The RADIUS protocol is currently defined in the following IETF RFC documents
Each of these three RADIUS responses may include a Reply-Message attribute which may give a reason for the rejection, the prompt for the challenge, or a welcome message for the accept
 Diameter is largely used in the 3G space
Typically, the client sends Accounting-Request packets until it receives an Accounting-Response acknowledgement, using some retry interval
Standards documentation
 Additionally, the request may contain other information which the NAS knows about the user, such as its network address or phone number, and information regarding the user's physical point of attachment to the NAS
 RADIUS proxy servers are used for centralized administration and can rewrite RADIUS packets on the fly (for security reasons, or to convert between vendor dialects)
 One of the largest barriers to having Diameter replace RADIUS is that switches and Access Points typically implement RADIUS, but not Diameter
RADIUS was originally specified in an RFI by Merit Network in 1991 to control dial-in access to NSFnet
 in 1991 as an access server authentication and accounting protocol and later brought into the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards
 This might be with a customizable login prompt, where the user is expected to enter their username and password
com\username@anotherdomain
The Authenticator is used to authenticate the reply from the RADIUS server, and is used in encrypting passwords; its length is 16 bytes
 SNMP is often used for remote monitoring and keep-alive checking of a RADIUS server
RADIUS is commonly used to facilitate roaming between ISPs, for example:
For example, the following authorization attributes may be included in an Access-Accept:
 RADIUS was later (1997) published as RFC 2058 and RFC 2059 (current versions are RFC 2865 and RFC 2866)
RADIUS is extensible; many vendors of RADIUS hardware and software implement their own variants using Vendor-Specific Attributes (VSAs)
 The text in the attribute can be passed on to the user in a return web page
 In that specification, the 'realm' portion is required to be a domain name
 Livingston Enterprises responded to the RFI with a description of a RADIUS server
 The fields are transmitted from left to right, starting with the code, the identifier, the length, the authenticator and the attributes
The RADIUS protocol transmits obfuscated passwords using a shared secret and the MD5 hashing algorithm
 The behavior of the proxying server regarding the removal of the realm from the request ("stripping") is configuration-dependent on most servers
 The length of the radius packet is used to determine the end of the AVPs
 The credentials are passed to the NAS device via the link-layer protocol - for example, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) in the case of many dialup or DSL providers or posted in an HTTPS secure web form
Accounting is described in RFC 2866.
The RADIUS Attribute Value Pairs (AVP) carry data in both the request and the response for the authentication, authorization, and accounting transactions
The Identifier field aids in matching requests and replies
When a RADIUS server receives an AAA request for a user name containing a realm, the server will reference a table of configured realms
Despite HarperCollins' predictions - and, according to Moore, their deliberately limited promotion of the book - the book became enormously popular, becoming the largest-selling nonfiction book for 2002 at such major outlets as Barnes & Noble and Amazon
 She expressed that "this battle wasn't just one man's struggle with a publishing house, but was a battle to preserve free speech and to stop censorship"
 It is generally known by its short title, "Stupid White Men
 Moore's "A Prayer to Afflict the Comfortable" was originally published in this book

Although the publishers were convinced it would be rejected by the American reading public after the September 11, 2001 attacks, it spent 50 consecutive weeks on the New York Times bestseller list (eight weeks at #1) for hardcover nonfiction and is in its 43rd printing
 He told the audience about the struggle to get his book published and that the only copies in existence were about to be recycled and probably would come back as Rush Limbaugh or Bill O'Reilly books

The book was subsequently criticized in another book, "Michael Moore Is a Big Fat Stupid White Man", which HarperCollins published
 In the audience that day was Ann Sparanese, a librarian from Englewood, New Jersey
Moore completed "Stupid White Men" shortly before the September 11, 2001 attacks
 They asked him to tone down criticism of the president
 They also wanted to change the title to "Michael Moore: The American", delete three chapters: "Kill Whitey!", "Dear George", "A Very American Coup" and insisted that Moore himself would have to pay the cost of printing the revised book, which was $100,000. If he didn't comply, they would simply abandon the project and pulp the books already printed

 Gaddis's papers are collected at Washington University in St
His life and work are the subject of a comprehensive website, which has been noted in at least one academic journal as a superior example of scholarship using new media resources
" Franzen continued: "In the four decades following the publication of "The Recognitions", Gaddis's work grew angrier and angrier
 Newspaper reviewers considered it overly intellectual, overwritten, and perhaps on the principle of ' ("all that is unknown appears obscene"), filthy
 Gaddis's influence is vast (although frequently subterranean): for example, postmodern authors such as Don DeLillo and Thomas Pynchon seem to have been influenced by Gaddis (indeed, upon publication of "V
Beside the awards for particular works, Gaddis has received three other awards and honors:

 Difficult', stating that "by a comfortable margin, the most difficult book I ever voluntarily read in its entirety was Gaddis' nine-hundred-and-fifty-six-page first novel, "The Recognitions"
 (DeLillo was a friend of Gaddis
 He worked as a fact checker for "The New Yorker" for little over a year (late February 1945 until late April 1946), then spent five years traveling in Mexico, Central America, Spain, France, England, and North Africa, returning to the United States in 1951.
 The first book-length biography, Joseph Tabbi's "Nobody Grew but the Business: On the Life and Work of William Gaddis," was published by Northwestern University Press in May 2015.
Gaddis then turned to public relations work and the making of documentary films to support himself and his family
 When he was 3, his parents separated and Gaddis was subsequently raised by his mother in Massapequa, Long Island
Legacy and influence
Among fans of post-modern fiction, Gaddis is often acknowledged as being one of the greatest of American post-war novelists
His first novel, "The Recognitions", appeared in 1955. A lengthy, complex, and allusive work, it had to wait to find its audience
 (The book was defended by Jack Green in a series of broadsheets blasting the critics; the series was collected later under the title "Fire the Bastards!") Shortly after the publication of "The Recognitions", Gaddis married his first wife, Patricia Black, who would give birth to two children: Sarah (who has written a novel, "Swallow Hard", inspired by her relationship with her father) and Matthew
", Pynchon was actually speculated to have been a pen name for Gaddis due to the similarity of styles and the dearth of information about the two authors; the Wanda Tinasky letters also claimed that Gaddis, Pynchon, and Jack Green were the same person), as well as authors such as Joseph McElroy, William Gass, David Markson, and David Foster Wallace, who have all stated their admiration for Gaddis in general and "The Recognitions" in particular
 National Book Award for Fiction
 In this role he worked for Pfizer, Eastman Kodak, IBM, and the United States Army, among others
 Instead of struggling against misanthropy (as in "The Recognitions") or reluctantly giving ground to it (as in "J R"), "Carpenter's Gothic" wallows in it
Characters in fiction based on Gaddis include "Harry Lees" in Chandler Brossard's 1952 novel "Who Walk in Darkness", "Harold Sand" in Jack Kerouac's autobiographical 1958 novella "The Subterraneans" and possibly "Bill Gray" in Don DeLillo's 1991 novel "Mao II"
 (December 29, 1922 – December 16, 1998) was an American novelist
The first and longest of his five novels, "The Recognitions", was named one of TIME magazine's 100 best novels from 1923 to 2005
Gaddis is widely considered one of the first and most important American postmodern writers
William Thomas Gaddis, Jr
 Critical opinion had caught up with him, and the book won the National Book Award for Fiction
His marriage to his second wife, Judith Thompson, dissolved shortly after "J R" was published
 In 1975 he published "J R",
 He continued in private school until the eighth grade, after which he returned to Long Island to receive his diploma at Farmingdale High School in 1941. He entered Harvard in 1941 and wrote for the "Harvard Lampoon" (where he eventually served as President), but was asked to leave in 1944 due to an altercation with police
 "The Letters of William Gaddis" was published by Dalkey Archive Press in February 2013.
told almost entirely in unattributed dialogue
A collection of his essays was published posthumously as "The Rush for Second Place" (2002)
 He also received a National Institute of Arts and Letters grant, a Rockefeller grant, and two National Endowment for the Arts grants, all of which helped him write his second novel
 "The Rush for Second Place", published at the same time, collected most of Gaddis's previously published nonfiction
 At age 5 he was sent to Merricourt Boarding School in Berlin, Connecticut
 A critic who early on appreciated his work and recognized its value is Steven Moore: in 1982 he published "A Reader's Guide to William Gaddis's "The Recognitions" and in 1989 a monograph on Gaddis in the Twayne series
Jonathan Franzen, who in an essay in "The New Yorker" called Gaddis "an old literary hero of mine", dubbed him 'Mr
Gaddis died at home in East Hampton, New York, of prostate cancer on December 16, 1998, but not before creating his final work, "Agapē Agape" (the first word of the title is the Greek "agapē", meaning divine, unconditional love), which was published in 2002, a novella in the form of the last words of a character similar but not identical to his creator
 By the late 1970s, Gaddis had entered into a relationship with Muriel Oxenberg Murphy, and they lived together until the mid-1990s
 The continual litigation that was a theme in that book becomes the central theme and plot device in "A Frolic of His Own" (1994)—which earned him his second National Book Award and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction—where it seems that everyone is suing someone
Gaddis was born in New York City to William Thomas Gaddis, who worked "on Wall Street and in politics", and Edith (Charles) Gaddis, an executive for the New York Steam Corporation
 It's a signature paradox of literary postmodernism: the writer whose least angry work was written first
"Carpenter's Gothic" (1985) offered a shorter and more accessible picture of Gaddis's worldview
) The characters "Richard Whitehurst" in Kurt Wenzel's "Lit Life: A Novel" (2001) and "Joshua Gel" in Stephen Dixon's "I: A Novel" (2002) likely are based on Gaddis
 Its eponymous protagonist, an 11-year-old, learns enough about the stock market from a class field trip to build a financial empire of his own
 Authors clearly influenced by Gaddis include Jonathan Franzen ("The Corrections"), David Markson ("Epitaph for a Tramp"), Joseph McElroy ("A Smuggler's Bible") and Stanley Elkin ("The Magic Kingdom")
 There are many theories about why he made this change
Andersen's decision to change the ending may have occurred after he read the manuscript tale to a child, or had its source in a childhood incident similar to that in the tale
 When the Emperor parades before his subjects in his new clothes, no one dares to say that he doesn't see any suit of clothes until a child cries out, "But he isn't wearing anything at all!" The tale has been translated into over a hundred languages
In 1985, Jack Herer published the first edition of "The Emperor Wears No Clothes"
 Then a child in the crowd, too young to understand the desirability of keeping up the pretense, blurts out that the Emperor is wearing nothing at all and the cry is taken up by others
 In "Hans Christian Andersen: The Life of a Storyteller", biographer Jackie Wullschlager points out that Andersen was not only a successful adapter of existing lore and literary material such as the Spanish source tale for "The Emperor's New Clothes" but also equally competent at creating new material that entered the human collective consciousness with the same mythic power as ancient, anonymous lore
The Emperor's New Clothes
 Most scholars agree that from his earliest years in Copenhagen, Andersen presented himself to the Danish bourgeoisie as the naïvely precocious child not usually admitted to the adult salon
Traditional Danish tales as well as German and French folktales were regarded as a form of exotica in nineteenth century Denmark and were read aloud to select gatherings by celebrated actors of the day
 Sight becomes insight, which, in turn, prompts action
 The story may be explained by pluralistic ignorance
Naomi Wood of Kansas State University challenges Robbins' reading, arguing that before the World Trade Center attacks of 2001, "Robbins's argument might seem merely playful, anti-intuitive, and provocative
 He later recalled standing in a crowd with his mother waiting to see King Frederick VI
 in the early 20th century
 Tatar is left wondering if the real value of the tale is the creation of the wonderful fabric in the reader's imagination or the tale's closing message of speaking truth no matter how humiliating to the recipient
 The first two booklets of the collection were published in May and December 1835 and met with little critical enthusiasm
 The television special features eight songs with music by Maury Laws and lyrics by Jules Bass, and combines live action filmed in Aarhus, Denmark, animation, special effects and the stop motion animation process "Animagic" made in Japan
Various adaptations of the tale have appeared since its first publication, including a 1919 Russian film directed by Yuri Zhelyabuzhsky, a 1987 musical starring Sid Caesar, and numerous short stories, plays, spoofs, and animated films
 Its beauty however is obscured at the end of the tale with the obligatory moral message for children
 Whatever the reason, Andersen thought the change would prove more satirical
In "The Annotated Hans Christian Andersen" (2008), folk and fairy tale researcher Maria Tatar offers a scholarly investigation and analysis of the story, drawing on Robbins' political and sociological analysis of the tale
" Robbins argues that Andersen's tale "quite clearly rehearses four contemporary controversies: the institution of a meritocratic civil service, the valuation of labor, the expansion of democratic power, and the appraisal of art"
 "The Emperor's New Clothes" became his expose of the hypocrisy and snobbery he found there when he finally gained admission
Jack Zipes, in "Hans Christian Andersen: The Misunderstood Storyteller", suggests that seeing is presented in the tale as the courage of one's convictions; Zipes believe this is the reason the story is popular with children
 When the king made his appearance, Andersen cried out, "Oh, he's nothing more than a human being!" His mother tried to silence him by crying, "Have you gone mad, child?"
Alison Prince, author of "Hans Christian Andersen: The Fan Dancer", claims that Andersen received a gift of a ruby and diamond ring from the king after publications of "The Emperor's New Clothes" and "The Swineherd"—tales in which Andersen voices a satirical disrespect for the court
In 1972, Rankin/Bass Productions adapted the tale as the first and only musical episode of the series "The Enchanted World of Danny Kaye" for the ABC network, featuring Danny Kaye, Cyril Ritchard, Imogene Coca, Allen Swift and Bob McFadden
 The Emperor's ministers cannot see the clothing themselves, but pretend that they can for fear of appearing unfit for their positions and the Emperor does the same
Hollis Robbins, in "The Emperor's New Critique" (2003), argues that the tale is itself so transparent "that there has been little need for critical scrutiny
 The Emperor cringes, suspects the assertion is true, but continues the procession
In 1980, computer scientist C
" With each successive description of the swindlers' wonderful cloth, it becomes more substantial, more palpable, and a thing of imaginative beauty for the reader even though it has no material existence
 Finally the swindlers report that the suit is finished, they mime dressing him and the Emperor marches in procession before his subjects
 The book is now in its 11th edition
"The Emperor's New Clothes" () is a short tale by Hans Christian Andersen about two weavers who promise an emperor a new suit of clothes that is invisible to those who are unfit for their positions, stupid, or incompetent
" Wood concludes: "Perhaps the truth of 'The Emperor's New Clothes' is not that the child's truth is mercifully free of adult corruption, but that it recognizes the terrifying possibility that whatever words we may use to clothe our fears, the fabric cannot protect us from them
 Scholars have noted that the phrase 'Emperor's new clothes' has become a standard metaphor for anything that smacks of pretentiousness, pomposity, social hypocrisy, collective denial, or hollow ostentatiousness
The phrase "emperor's new clothes" has become an idiom about logical fallacies
 The tale has been adapted to various media, including the musical stage and animated film
 Tatar points out that Robbins indicates the swindling weavers are simply insisting that "the value of their labor be recognized apart from its material embodiment", and notes that Robbins considers the ability of some in the tale to see the invisible cloth as "a successful enchantment"
"The Emperor’s New Clothes" was first published with "The Little Mermaid" in Copenhagen by C
 Historically, the tale established Andersen's reputation as a children's author whose stories actually imparted lessons of value for his juvenile audience, and "romanticized" children by "investing them with the courage to challenge authority and to speak truth to power
 Tired by speaking various foreign languages and on the verge of vomiting after days of feasting, the author managed to control his body and read aloud "The Princess and the Pea", "Little Ida's Flowers", and "The Emperor's New Clothes"
 Andersen's tales eventually became a part of the repertoire and readings of "The Emperor's New Clothes" became a specialty of and a big hit for the popular Danish actor Ludvig Phister
 Andersen did not know the Spanish original but read the tale in a German translation titled "So ist der Lauf der Welt"
 Andersen waited a year before publishing the third installment of the collection
 This book uncovers the history of industrial hemp through civilization, culminating to a propaganda campaign in the U
In 2010, Chicago Shakespeare Theater commissioned a new family musical version written by Alan Schmuckler and Dave Holstein
 Reitzel in Copenhagen as the third and final installment of the first collection of Andersen's "Fairy Tales Told for Children"
Andersen's tale is based on a story from the "Libro de los ejemplos" (or "El Conde Lucanor", 1335), a medieval Spanish collection of fifty-one cautionary tales with various sources such as Aesop and other classical writers and Persian folktales, by Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena (1282–1348)
 Or alternatively, everyone is ignorant to whether the Emperor has clothes on or not, but believes that everyone else is not ignorant
 Robbins concludes that the story's appeal lies in its "seductive resolution" of the conflict by the truth-telling boy
"The Emperor's New Clothes" was first published with "The Little Mermaid" on 7 April 1837 by C
 She points out that after "The Swineherd", he never again wrote a tale colored with political satire, but, within months of the gift, began composing "The Ugly Duckling", a tale about a bird born in a henyard who, after a lifetime of misery, matures into a swan, "one of those royal birds"
 In the source tale, a king is hoodwinked by weavers who claim to make a suit of clothes invisible to any man not the son of his presumed father; whereas Andersen altered the source tale to direct the focus on courtly pride and intellectual vanity rather than adulterous paternity
On 1 July 1844, the Hereditary Grand Duke Carl Alexander held a literary soiree at Ettersburg in honor of Andersen
 The townsfolk play along with the pretense, not wanting to appear unfit for their positions or stupid
Tatar observes that "The Emperor's New Clothes" is one of Andersen's best known tales and one that has acquired an iconic status globally as it migrates across various cultures reshaping itself with each retelling in the manner of oral folktales
Andersen's manuscript was at the printer's when he was suddenly inspired to change the original climax of the tale from the emperor's subjects admiring his invisible clothes to that of the child's cry
A vain Emperor who cares about nothing except wearing and displaying clothes hires two swindlers who promise him the finest, best suit of clothes from a fabric invisible to anyone who is unfit for his position or "hopelessly stupid"
 Prince suggests the ring was an attempt to curb Andersen's sudden bent for political satire by bringing him into the royal fold
The story is about a situation where "no one believes, but everyone believes that everyone else believes
 Hoare used a parody tale, The Emperor's Old Clothes, to advocate simplification over embellishment, for clothing or computer sorting algorithms
 Reitzel on 7 April 1837 as the third and final installment of Andersen's "Fairy Tales Told for Children"
The 1987 Japanese war documentary film The Emperor's Naked Army Marches On, by director Kazuo Hara, centers on 62-year-old Kenzo Okuzaki, veteran of Japan's Second World War campaign in New Guinea, and follows him around as he searches out those responsible for the unexplained deaths of two soldiers in his old unit

The initial active ingredient was the first synthetic pyrethroid, allethrin
 Conjuring up images of an Eliot Ness-style raid on an illegal bar during Prohibition, the television spots have featured the cartoon bugs (voiced by Mel Blanc) plotting some silly scheme like invading a kitchen, only to be foiled by the magical appearance of the product which swiftly dispatched the bugs to various giddily horrible deaths
 Johnson & Son, first launched in 1956.
 Artist Don Pegler developed the bug characters used in the US and continued animating them for forty years
The product's advertising tagline, "Raid Kills Bugs Dead," was created by the advertising agency Foote, Cone & Belding
 The phrase itself is often attributed to the poet Lew Welch, who worked for the agency at the time
The line was first used in commerce in 1966 and was trademarked in 1986. Animation director Tex Avery was the producer of the first "Kills Bugs Dead" commercials

 The most common connectors are 6.35 mm (¼″) and 3.5 mm phone connectors
Dangers and volume solutions
Headsets can have ergonomic benefits over traditional telephone handsets
 Consequently, newer amplifiers are based on designs with relatively low output impedance
Unwanted sound from the environment can be reduced by excluding sound from the ear by passive noise isolation, or, often in conjunction with isolation, by active noise cancellation
Generic or custom fitting ear canal plugs are made from silicone rubber, elastomer, or foam
 Such a chip is composed of a layer of CNT thin yarn array supported by the silicon wafer, and periodic grooves with certain depth are made on the wafer by micro-fabrication methods to suppress the heat leakage from the CNT yarn to the substrate
The design is not mechanically stable; a slight imbalance makes the armature stick to one pole of the magnet
Headphones may be used to prevent other people from hearing the sound either for privacy or to prevent disturbance, as in listening in a public library
 Part of their ability to do so comes from the lack of any need to perform room correction treatments with headphones
Headphones (or "head-phones" in the early days of telephony and radio) are a pair of small loudspeakers that are designed to be held in place close to a user's ears
 Telephone amplifiers are powered by batteries or AC adaptors
 Because these headphones completely surround the ear, circumaural headphones can be designed to fully seal against the head to attenuate external noise
 Supra-aural headphones can also lead to discomfort due to the pressure on the ear as compared to circumaural headphones that sit around the ear
 Commercial recordings almost always use stereo recording, rather than binaural, because loudspeaker listening has been more popular than headphone listening
Headphones may be used with stationary CD and DVD players, home theater, personal computers, or portable devices (e
 Earphones are portable and convenient, but many people consider them to be uncomfortable and prone to falling out
 A few combine an armature driver with a small moving-coil driver for increased bass output
Wired headphones are attached to an audio source by a cable
 The requirement for high sensitivity meant that no damping was used, thus the sound quality was crude
 Stereo recordings represent the position of horizontal depth cues (stereo separation) via volume and phase differences of the sound in question between the two channels
 The folded shape of a diaphragm allows a transducer with a larger surface area to fit within smaller space constraints
 Some of these achieved astonishing electro-acoustic conversion efficiencies, in the range of 20% to 40%, for narrow bandwidth voice signals
 High quality headphones can have an extremely flat low-frequency response down to 20 Hz within 3 dB
 Noise cancelling headphones are so effective that a person may not be able to hear oncoming traffic or pay attention to people around them
 They are electroacoustic transducers, which convert an electrical signal to a corresponding sound in the user's ear
 The high frequency response means that the low midband distortion level is maintained to the top of the audible frequency band, which is generally not the case with moving coil drivers
Headphone size can affect the balance between fidelity and portability
 As of 2015, most headphones are amplified by a headphone amplifier, either an integrated amplifier (e
 In the context of telecommunication, a headset is a combination of headphone and microphone
 Through most headphones, because the right and left channels do not combine in this manner, the illusion of the phantom center can be perceived as lost
Sensitivity is a measure of how effectively an earpiece converts an incoming electrical signal into an audible sound
 Using this standard, headphones with sensitivities of 90, 100 and 110 dB (SPL)/V should be driven by an amplifier capable of no more than 3.162, 1.0 and 0.3162 RMS volts at maximum volume setting, respectively to reduce the risk of hearing damage
 In addition, a special amplifier is required to amplify the signal to deflect the membrane, which often requires electrical potentials in the range of 100 to 1000 volts
 Marketed claims such as 'frequency response 4 Hz to 20 kHz' are usually overstatements; the product's response at frequencies lower than 20 Hz is typically very small
 Additionally, there was also one attempt to market a plasma-ionisation headphone in the early 1990s by a French company called Plasmasonics
 For example, for a headphone with a sensitivity of 100 dB (SPL)/V, an amplifier with an output of 1 root-mean-square (RMS) voltage will produce a maximum volume of 100 dB
 Some models have been specifically designed for drummers, with the aim to be able to monitor the recorded sound while shutting out the sound coming directly from the drums at the same time as much as possible
 Well-designed electrostatic headphones can produce significantly better sound quality than other types
Transducer technologies employed much less commonly for headphones include the Heil Air Motion Transformer (AMT); Piezoelectric film; Ribbon planar magnetic; Magnetostriction and Plasma-ionisation
Closed-back (or sealed) styles have the back of the earcups closed
 It thus indicates how loud the headphones will be for a given electrical drive level
In-ear headphones, also known as in-ear monitors (IEMs) or canalphones, are small headphones with similar portability to earbuds which are inserted in the ear canal itself
Electrostatic headphones require a voltage source generating 100 V to over 1 kV, and are on the user's head
 In military applications, audio signals of many varieties are monitored using headphones
 It was normally connected directly to the positive high voltage battery terminal, and the other battery terminal was securely grounded
 If output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the headphones, significantly higher distortion will be present
 The larger 6.35 mm connector is more common on fixed location home or professional equipment
 In recent years, impedance of newer headphones has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on battery powered CMOS-based portable electronics
 They are sold at times with foam pads for comfort
The moving coil driver, more commonly referred to as a "dynamic" driver is the most common type used in headphones
It is possible to change the spatial effects of stereo sound on headphones, to better approximate the presentation of speaker reproduction, by using frequency-dependent cross-feed between the channels
 The first Heil AMT headphone was marketed by ESS Laboratories and was essentially an ESS AMT tweeter from one of the company's speakers being driven at full range
Some very sensitive headphones, such as those manufactured by Brandes around 1919, were commonly used for early radio work
 On the other hand, they let the user be better aware of their surroundings
 A Finnish study recommended that exercisers should set their headphone volumes to half of their normal loudness and only use them for half an hour
 They require a power source, usually a battery, to drive their circuitry
Various types of transducer are used to convert electrical signals to sound in headphones
 They provide hardly any acoustic isolation and leave room for ambient noise to seep in; users may turn up the volume dangerously high to compensate, at the risk of causing hearing loss
 The headphone volume often has to compete with the background noise, especially in loud places such as subway stations, aircraft, and large crowds
 Typical closed-back headphones block 8 to 12 dB, and in-ears anywhere from 10 to 15 dB
 Open-back and earbud headphones provide some passive noise isolation, but much less than the others
 Active noise cancelling headphones can attenuate ambient noise by 20 dB or more, but the active circuitry is mainly effective on constant sounds and at lower frequencies, rather than sharp sounds and voices
 Where the open-back approach has hardly any measure to block sound at the outer side of the diaphragm, and the closed-back approach really has a closed chamber at the outer side of the diaphragm, a semi-open headphone can have a chamber to block sound partially while leaving some sound through, via openings or vents
Some studies has found somewhat increased risks for temporary hearing damage from listening to music during strenuous exercise, compared to when listening at rest
The thermoacoustic effect generates sound from the audio frequency Joule heating of the conductor, an effect which is not magnetic and does not vibrate the speaker
 Although this reduces its efficiency, this design can still produce more sound from less power than any other
Magnetostriction headphones, sometimes sold under the label of "Bonephones", are headphones that work via the transmission of vibrations against the side of head, transmitting the sound via bone conduction
" Some manufacturers of portable music devices have attempted to introduce safety circuitry that limited output volume or warned the user when dangerous volume was being used, but the concept has been rejected by most of the buying public, which favors the personal choice of high volume
Electrical characteristics
The earliest loudspeakers for radio receivers used balanced armature drivers for their cones
 Headphones that use cables typically have either a 1/4 inch (6.35mm) or 1/8 inch (3.5mm) phone jack for plugging the headphones into the audio source
 The maximum sound pressure level is a matter of preference, with some sources recommending no higher than 110 to 120 dB
 The headphone types that provide most attenuation are in-ear canal headphones and closed-back headphones, both circumaural and supra aural
 Because of their size, circumaural headphones can be heavy and there are some sets that weigh over
 Also, the frequency response peakiness regularly seen in the high frequency region with moving coil drivers is absent
 The diaphragm, typically fabricated from lightweight, high stiffness to mass ratio cellulose, polymer, carbon material, or the like, is attached to a coil of wire (voice coil) which is immersed in the static magnetic field of the stationary magnet
Active noise-cancelling headphones use a microphone, amplifier, and speaker to pick up, amplify, and play ambient noise in phase-reversed form; this to some extent cancels out unwanted noise from the environment without affecting the desired sound source, which is not picked up and reversed by the microphone
 Koss, an audiophile and jazz musician from Milwaukee, produced the first stereo headphones
The impedance of headphones is of concern because of the output limitations of amplifiers
 When precisely centered in the magnetic field there is no net force on the armature, hence the term 'balanced
 In studio recordings, musicians and singers use headphones to play or sing along to a backing track or band
 Headsets are made with either a single-earpiece (mono) or a double-earpiece (mono to both ears or stereo)
Because in-ear headphones engage the ear canal, they can be less prone to falling out and they block out much environmental noise
 Popularized in the 1920s as Baldwin Mica Diaphragm radio headphones, balanced armature transducers were refined during World War II for use in military sound powered telephones
 The microphone arm of headsets is either an external microphone type where the microphone is held in front of the user's mouth, or a voicetube type where the microphone is housed in the earpiece and speech reaches it by means of a hollow tube
 Headsets are widely used for telephone-intensive jobs, in particular by call centre workers
Headphones are made in a range of different audio reproduction quality capabilities
 This has the additional undesirable effect of being dependent of the efficiency of the headphones; a device producing the maximum allowed power may not produce adequate volume in low-efficiency high-quality headphones, while possibly reaching dangerous levels in very efficient ones
 Sony introduced the smaller, and now widely used, 3.5 mm "minijack" stereo connector in 1979, adapting the older monophonic 3.5 mm connector for use with its Walkman portable stereo tape player
 Cordless bluetooth headsets are available, and often used with mobile telephones
 This is particularly helpful in situations where the ears must be left unobstructed or when used by those who are deaf for reasons which do not affect the nervous apparatus of hearing
 In radio studios, DJs use a pair of headphones when talking to the microphone while the speakers are turned off to eliminate acoustic feedback while monitoring their own voice
Due to the extremely thin and light diaphragm membrane, often only a few micrometers thick, and the complete absence of moving metalwork, the frequency response of electrostatic headphones usually extends well above the audible limit of approximately 20 kHz
Telephone headsets connect to a fixed-line telephone system
 Koss introduced the "Safelite" line of cassette players in 1983 with such a warning light
 The operating principle consists of a stationary magnetic element affixed to the frame of the headphone which sets up a static magnetic field
This configuration also usually benefits from a good quality of bass response, due to the large surface area of the membrane producing the pressure waves required for low frequency sound
 Since the early days of the transistor radio, earphones have commonly been bundled with personal music devices
A balanced armature is a sound transducer design primarily intended to increase the electrical efficiency of the element by eliminating the stress on the diaphragm characteristic of many other magnetic transducer systems
 The as-produced CNT thin yarn earphone has a working element called CNT thin yarn thermoacoustic chip
Headphones are also useful for video games that use 3D positional audio processing algorithms, as they allow players to better judge the position of an off-screen sound source (such as the footsteps of an opponent or their gun fire)
 Headsets designed for telephone use typically cannot reproduce sound with the high fidelity of expensive units designed for music listening by audiophiles
 They operate similarly to Planar Magnetic Loudspeakers
 They can also provide a level of sound fidelity greater than loudspeakers of similar cost
 The ear can normally detect 1-billionth of an atmosphere of sound pressure level, hence it is incredibly sensitive
 It can be measured in decibels of sound pressure level per milliwatt (dB (SPL)/mW) or decibels of sound pressure level per volt (dB (SPL) / V)
 Among applications for headsets, besides telephone use, are aviation, theatre or television studio intercom systems, and console or PC gaming
 They usually block some of the ambient noise, but have a smaller soundstage, giving the wearer a perception that the sound is coming from within their head
Pairing high sensitivity headphones with power amplifiers can produce dangerously high volumes and damage headphones
 The 3.5 mm connector remains the most widely-used connector for portable application today
 This type of headphone generally tends to be smaller and lighter than circumaural headphones, resulting in less attenuation of outside noise
 Electrets are also typically cheaper and lower in technical capability and fidelity than electrostatics
 Currently TakeT produce a piezoelectric film headphone which is shaped not unlike an AMT transducer but which like the driver Precide uses for their headphones, has a variation in the size of transducer folds over the diaphragm
 Hard panned sounds will also only be heard only in one ear rather than from one side
The usual way of limiting sound volume on devices driving headphones is by limiting output power
 In this case, an external headphone amplifier may be beneficial
 Since the turn of the century, only Precide of Switzerland have manufactured an AMT headphone
Semi-open headphones, have a design that can be considered as a compromise between open-back headphones and closed-back headphones
 Custom in-ear headphones use castings of the ear canal to create custom-molded plugs that provide added comfort and noise isolation
 Such headphones claim to reduce ambient noise by around 25 dB
 Cordless headphones are used with events such as a Silent disco or Silent Gig
 This may imply that the result combines all the positive properties of both designs
 While there is no exact definition for the term semi-open headphone, there are designs that can be considered as such
 Cordless headphones are not connected to their source by a cable
 The magnetic element in headphones is typically composed of ferrite or neodymium
Electrostatic drivers consist of a thin, electrically charged diaphragm, typically a coated PET film membrane, suspended between two perforated metal plates (electrodes)
 Headphones are designed to allow a single user to listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a loudspeaker, which emits sound into the open air, allowing anyone nearby to listen
 Headphones either connect directly to a signal source such as an audio amplifier, radio, CD player, portable media player, mobile phone, video game consoles, electronic musical instrument, or use wireless technology such as bluetooth or FM radio
 When the sounds from two speakers mix, they create the phase difference the brain uses to locate direction
In early powered radios, the headphone was part of the vacuum tube's plate circuit and carried dangerous voltages
 As the impedance of a pair of headphones increases, more voltage (at a given current) is required to drive it, and the loudness of the headphones for a given voltage decreases
Alternatively, online calculators can be used
This reduces the possibility of distortion at different frequencies across different parts of the membrane, as may occur in dynamic drivers
The government of France has imposed a limit on all music players sold in the country: they must not be capable of producing more than 100dBA (the threshold of hearing damage during extended listening is 80 dB, and the threshold of pain, or theoretically of immediate hearing loss, is 130 dB)
 These early headphones used moving iron drivers, with either single ended or balanced armatures
 Generally, headphone form factors can be divided into four separate categories: "circumaural", "supra-aural", "earbud", and "in-ear"
Open-back headphones have the back of the earcups open
Transducer technology
 IEMs are higher quality in-ear headphones and are used by audio engineers and musicians as well as audiophiles
 Electrostatic headphones are usually more expensive than moving-coil ones, and are comparatively uncommon
 It additionally incorporates a two way design by its inclusion of a dedicated tweeter/supertweeter panel
 Impedance of 1000 to 2000 ohms was common, which suited both crystal sets and triode receivers
 The diaphragm is actuated by the attached voice coil, when the varying current of an audio signal is passed through the coil
In 2013 a carbon nanotube thin-yarn earphone based on the thermoacoustic mechanism was demonstrated by a research group in Tsinghua University
, digital audio player/mp3 player, mobile phone)
Other transducer technologies
 Headsets are also available with 2.5 mm jack sockets for many DECT phones and other applications
 They do not need to deliver significant electric current, which limits the electrical hazard to the wearer in case of fault
An orthodynamic driver consists of a relatively large membrane suspended between two sets of permanent, oppositely aligned, magnets
 Since the entire membrane is equally charged, and suspended within a uniform magnetic field, changes in the electrical charge produce uniform movement across the entire membrane surface
 Whilst they do not require as much power as electrostatic headphones in order to give acceptable levels of volume and audio quality, they do require significantly more than most dynamic driver headphones
 Extended periods of exposure to high sound pressure levels created by headphones at high volume settings may be damaging; however, one hearing expert found that "fewer than 5% of users select volume levels and listen frequently enough to risk hearing loss
 Higher-end models may employ multiple armature drivers, dividing the frequency ranges between them using a passive crossover network
Thermoacoustic technology
Historically, many headphones had relatively high impedance, often over 500 ohms in order to operate well with high impedance tube amplifiers
 This has resulted in headphones that can be more efficiently driven by battery powered electronics
 below 20 Hz and above 16 kHz) and require a better seal than other types of drivers to deliver their full potential
 As shown schematically in the first diagram, it consists of a moving magnetic armature that is pivoted so it can move in the field of the permanent magnet
Electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers may be readily applied to headphones, because most headphones are small dynamic loudspeakers
Supra-aural headphones have pads that press against the ears, rather than around them
 Most models of telephone amplifiers offer volume control for loudspeaker as well as microphone, mute function and switching between headset and handset
 Electret and electrostatic headphones are relatively uncommon
 The other type, known as earbuds or earphones consist of individual units that plug into the user's ear canal
 Previously, headphones were used only by telephone and radio operators, and individuals in similar industries
 Modern moving-coil headphone drivers are derived from microphone capsule technology
 Air is forced through the perforations; combined with a continuously changing electrical signal driving the membrane, a sound wave is generated
 Adapters are available for converting between 6.35 mm and 3.5 mm devices
 They generally are limited at the extremes of the hearing spectrum (e
' As illustrated in the second diagram, when there is electric current through the coil, it magnetizes the armature one way or the other, causing it to rotate slightly one way or the other about the pivot thus moving the diaphragm to make sound
 The alternating magnetic field produced by the current through the coil reacts against the static magnetic field in turn, causing the coil and attached diaphragm to move the air, thus producing sound
 The use of bare electrical connections meant that users could be shocked if they touched the bare headphone connections while adjusting an uncomfortable headset
A headset is a headphone combined with a microphone
 These are powered receiver systems, of which the headphone is only a component
Both circumaural and supra-aural headphones can be further differentiated by the type of earcups:
 Those used with early wireless radio had to be more sensitive and were made with more turns of finer wire
 Headphones are also known as earspeakers, earphones or, colloquially, cans
The membrane is then electrically charged in order to induce movement in the membrane and produce sound
 In contrast, modern transistor amplifiers can have very low output impedance, enabling lower impedance headphones
Overall, orthodynamic headphones are considered to have very high-fidelity sound quality
 However the electret driver has a permanent charge built into it, where electrostatics have the charge applied to the driver by an external generator
Earphones (popularly called "earbuds" in recent years) are very small headphones that are fitted directly in the outer ear, facing but not inserted in the ear canal
For older models of telephones, the headset microphone impedance is different from that of the original handset, requiring a telephone amplifier for the telephone headset
 A telephone amplifier provides basic pin-alignment similar to a telephone headset adaptor, but it also offers sound amplification for the microphone as well as the loudspeakers
 Lack of sound from the environment can be a problem when sound is a necessary cue for safety or other reasons, as when walking, driving, or riding near or in vehicular traffic
 Low-impedance headphones are in the range 16 to 32 ohms and high-impedance headphones are about 100-600 ohms
 They were commonly bundled with personal stereos during the 1980s
 Unfortunately, this means that older audio amplifiers or stereos often produce poor quality output on some modern, low impedance headphones
 Once the sensitivity per volt is known, the maximum volume for a pair of headphones can be easily calculated from the maximum amplifier output voltage
 As such, most orthodynamic headphones require substantial amplification
However, the large permanent magnet configurations cause orthodynamic headphones to often be considerably heavier than their dynamic or electrostatic counterparts
 The electrical sound signal is applied to the electrodes creating an electrical field; depending on the polarity of this field, the diaphragm is drawn towards one of the plates
 A modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load
 There is also a general danger that music in headphones can distract the listener and lead to dangerous situations
Orthodynamic headphones have a number of advantages and disadvantages
Passive noise canceling headphones can be considered dangerous because of a lack of awareness the listener may have with their environment
 Their impedance varied; headphones used in telegraph and telephone work had an impedance of 75 ohms
 The line was discontinued two years later for lack of interest
In the professional audio sector, headphones are used in live situations by disc jockeys with a DJ mixer, and sound engineers for monitoring signal sources
 In contrast, the American Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends an average SPL of no more than 85 dB(A) to avoid long-term hearing loss, while the European Union standard EN 50332-1:2013 recommends that volumes above 85 dB(A) include a warning, with an absolute maximum volume (defined using 40–4000 Hz noise) of no more than 100 dB to avoid accidental hearing damage
Orthodynamic (also known as Planar Magnetic) headphones use similar technology to electrostatic headphones, with some fundamental differences
 This increases the total volume of air that can be moved on each excursion of the transducer given that radiating area
Although modern headphones have been particularly widely sold and used for listening to stereo recordings since the release of the Walkman, there is subjective debate regarding the nature of their reproduction of stereo sound
Headphones are available with low or high impedance (typically measured at 1 kHz)
Headphones originated from the earpiece, and were the only way to listen to electrical audio signals before amplifiers were developed
 Headsets for standard corded telephones are fitted with a standard 4P4C commonly called an RJ-9 connector
 In order to ensure an even frequency response, adequate damping factor, and undistorted sound, an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible)
Benefits and limitations
 They allow call center agents to maintain better posture without needing to hand-hold a handset or tilt their head sideways to cradle it
, in an iPod) or a standalone unit
 They are also used by anyone wishing to hold telephone conversations with both hands free
Using headphones at a sufficiently high volume level may cause temporary or permanent hearing impairment or deafness
An electret driver functions along the same electromechanical means as an electrostatic driver
Today they are typically used only in in-ear headphones and hearing aids, where their diminutive size is a major advantage
The sensitivity of headphones is usually between about 80 and 125 dB/mW and usually measured at 1 kHz
 It is believed that there are no functioning examples left
 As the output voltage (but not power) of a headphone amplifier is essentially constant for most common headphones, dB/mW is often more useful if converted into dB/V using Ohm's Law:
 Instead, they receive a radio or infrared signal encoded using a radio or infrared transmission link, such as FM, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
 Therefore, lower impedance headphones will tend to be louder and more efficient, but will also demand a more capable amplifier
 Circumaural and supra-aural headphones use a band over the top of the head to hold the speakers in place
 These early models lacked padding, and often produced excessive clamping forces on the wearer's head
 Unfortunately, both definitions are widely used, often interchangeably
Circumaural headphones (sometimes called full size headphones) have circular or ellipsoid earpads that encompass the ears
Passive noise isolation is essentially using the body of the earphone, either over or in the ear, as a passive earplug that simply blocks out sound
Ambient noise reduction
 Closed-back headphones tend to be able to produce stronger low frequencies than open-back headphones
 Some noise cancelling headphones are designed mainly to reduce low-frequency engine and travel noise in aircraft, trains, and automobiles, and are less effective in environments with other types of noise
 The first truly successful set was developed in 1910 by Nathaniel Baldwin, who made them by hand in his kitchen and sold them to the United States Navy
 A fairly stiff restoring force is required to hold the armature in the 'balance' position
Motorcycle and other power-sport riders benefit by wearing foam earplugs when legal to do so to avoid excessive road, engine, and wind noise, but their ability to hear music and intercom speech is enhanced when doing so
 Some believe the term "semi-open" is purely there for marketing purposes
 This leaks more sound out of the headphone and also lets more ambient sounds into the headphone, but gives a more natural or speaker-like sound and more spacious "soundstage" - the perception of distance from the source
 A telephone headset functions by replacing the handset of a telephone
 Comfort may vary due to the earcup material
Binaural recordings use a different microphone technique to encode direction directly as phase, with very little amplitude difference below 2 kHz, often using a dummy head, and can produce a surprisingly lifelike spatial impression through headphones
 Higher impedance headphones will be more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but will produce less volume for a given output level
 Piezoelectric film headphones were first developed by Pioneer, their two models both used a flat sheet of film which limited the maximum volume of air that could be moved
 Ergonomic headband and earpad design is required to reduce discomfort resulting from weight
 Amplifiers are not ideal; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide
 At very high sound pressure levels, muscles in the ear tighten the tympanic membrane and this leads to a small change in the geometry of the ossicles and stirrup that results in lower transfer of force to the oval window of the inner ear (the acoustic reflex)
 Magnetostriction headphones though, have greater limitations to their fidelity than conventional headphones which work via the normal workings of the ear
 Headsets provide the equivalent functionality of a telephone handset with hands-free operation
Finally the defection of the Radical and Socialist groups induced him to resign on 17 January 1905, although he had not met an adverse vote in the Chamber
In October 1904, his Minister of War, General André, was uncovered 'republicanizing' the army
 In 1903, safety standards were extended to shops and offices
 In 1885 he was elected to the senate by the "départment" of Charente-Inférieure
 Exposed as the Affaire Des Fiches, the scandal undermined support for the Combes government
 Among people who looked with favor on his stubborn enforcement of the law, he was familiarly called "le petit père"
 While still possessed of great influence over extreme Radicals, Combes took but little public part in politics after his resignation of the premiership in 1905. He joined the Aristide Briand ministry of October 1915 as one of the five Elder Statesmen, but without portfolio
Émile Combes was born in Roquecourbe, Tarn
 In this he took the portfolio of the Interior, and the main energy of the government was devoted to an anti-clerical agenda, partly in response to the Dreyfus Affair
 It also undermined morale in the army, as officers realized that hostile spies examining their private lives were more important to their careers than their own professional accomplishments
 He used Freemasons to spy on the religious behavior of all 19,000 officers; they flagged the observant Catholics and André made sure they would not be promoted
He actively supported the Waldeck-Rousseau ministry, and upon its retirement in 1902 he was himself charged with the formation of a cabinet
He was vigorously opposed by all the Conservative parties, who saw the mass closure of church schools as a persecution of religion
 In 1881 he presented himself as a political candidate for Saintes, but was defeated
According to Geoffrey Kurtz, the years of Émile Combe's administration was a period of social reform “without equal” during the era of the Third Republic, which included such reforms as an eight-hour day for miners, a ten-hour day for many workers, the lowering of mandatory military service from 3 to 2 years, the elimination of certain middle-class draft exemptions, and some modest public assistance for the chronically ill, the disabled, and the elderly
 He took the promotion process out of the hands of senior officers and handled it directly as a political matter
 By 1904, through his efforts, nearly 10,000 religious schools had been closed and thousands of priests and nuns left France rather than be persecuted
 He later took a diploma as a doctor of letters (1860)
 His anti-clericalism would later lead him into becoming a Freemason
 He was also in later life a spiritualist
 Then he studied medicine, taking his degree in 1867, and setting up in practice at Pons in Charente-Inférieure
 His policy was still carried on; and when the law of the separation of church and state was passed, all the leaders of the Radical parties entertained him at a noteworthy banquet in which they openly recognized him as the real originator of the movement
Émile Justin Louis Combes (; 6 September 1835 – 25 May 1921) was a French statesman and freemason who led the Bloc des gauches's cabinet from June 1902 – January 1905.
 He studied for the priesthood, but abandoned the idea before ordination
 The parties of the Left, united upon this question in the "Bloc republicain", supported Combes in his application of the law of 1901 on the religious associations, and voted the new bill on the congregations (1904), and under his guidance France took the first definite steps toward the separation of church and state
 He sat in the Democratic left, and was elected vice-president in 1893 and 1894. The reports which he drew up upon educational questions drew attention to him, and on 3 November 1895 he entered the Bourgeois cabinet as minister of public instruction, resigning with his colleagues on 21 April following
The campaign for the separation of church and state was the last big political action in his life
 As such a skin can completely change look and feel and navigation interface of a piece of application software or operating system
Probably the most popular skins are for instant messaging clients, media center, and media player software, such as Trillian and Winamp, due to the association with fun that such programs try to encourage
 For those that do not, there are usually programs that can add the functionality, like WindowBlinds for Microsoft Windows and ShapeShifter for Mac OS X
 A user interface that has been extensively customized by one person may appear completely unfamiliar to another who knows the software under a different appearance
It is also possible to change the standard interface
 Some platforms have support for this built in, including most using the X Window System
 While some find it useful or pleasant to be able to change the appearance of software, a changed appearance can complicate technical support and training
 As with standalone software interfaces, this is facilitated by the underlying technology of the website—XML and XSLT, for instance, facilitate major changes of layout, while CSS can easily produce different visual styles
 Some usability practitioners feel that this flexibility requires interaction design expertise that users might not have
Software that is capable of having a skin applied is referred to as being skinnable, and the process of writing or applying such a skin is known as skinning
Skinning is typically implemented with a model–view–controller architecture, which allows for a flexible structure in which the interface is independent from and indirectly linked to application functionality, so the GUI can be easily customized
Many websites are skinnable, particularly those that provide social capabilities
 Applying a skin changes a piece of software's look and feel – some skins merely make the program more aesthetically pleasing, but others can rearrange elements of the interface, potentially making the program easier to use
 This allows the user to select or design a different skin at will, and also allows for more deep changes in the position and function of the interface elements
Model–view–controller
 Some sites provide skins that make primarily cosmetic changes, while some—such as H2G2—offer skins that make major changes to page layout
 Although often used simply as a synonym for "skin", the term "theme" normally refers to less-complex customizations, such as a set of icons and matching colour scheme for an operating system – notably, this is how the term was used in association with Windows 95 and Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95.
In computing, a skin (also known as visual styles in Windows XP) is a custom graphical appearance preset package achieved by the use of a graphical user interface (GUI) that can be applied to specific computer software, operating system, and websites to suit the purpose, topic, or tastes of different users
Common skinnable applications
The benefit of skinning in user interfaces is disputed
 A skin may also be associated with themes, which usually only implies part changes and smaller differences, such as colors and similar

" The institute believes that the notion that if a person identifies as bisexual, then it is a reinforcement of a false gender binary is a notion that "has its roots in the anti-science, anti-Enlightenment philosophy that has ironically found a home within many Queer Studies departments at universities across the Anglophone world" and that "while it is true that our society's language and terminology do not necessarily reflect the full spectrum of human gender diversity, that is hardly the fault of people who choose to identify as bi
 ' comes from a Latin term meaning "all"
 However, bisexual-identified people and scholars may object to the notion that bisexuality means sexual attraction to only two genders, arguing that since "bisexual" is not simply about attraction to two sexes and encompasses gender as well, it can include attraction to more than two genders
 Given those fundamental facts, any criticism of bisexuality as reinforcing a gender binary is misplaced
Scholar Shiri Eisner states that terms such as "pansexual," "omnisexual," "polysexual," "queer", etc
 This is distinct from polyamory, which means more than one intimate relationship at the same time with the knowledge and consent of everyone involved
Go Ask Alice! states that pansexuals can be attracted to cisgender people, "transmen, transwomen, intersex people, androgynous people, and everything else
 Credited to Sigmund Freud, it is a term of reproach leveled at early psychology, and is also defined as "the pervasion of all conduct and experience with sexual emotions"
" Eisner argues that "the allegations of binarism have little to do with bisexuality's actual attributes or bisexual people's behavior in real life" and that the allegations are a political method to keep the bisexual and transgender movements separated, because of those who believe that bisexuality ignores or erases the visibility of transgender and genderqueer people
 To what extent the term "bisexual" is inclusive when compared to the term "pansexual" is debated within the LGBT community, especially the bisexual community
 Pansexual people may refer to themselves as gender-blind, asserting that gender and sex are insignificant or irrelevant in determining whether they will be sexually attracted to others
 Furthermore, the term "bisexual" is sometimes defined as the romantic or sexual attraction to multiple genders
 same sex) and "heterosexual" (lit
 Over time, our society's concept of human sex and gender may well change
 Using these definitions, pansexuality is defined differently by explicitly including people who are intersex or outside the gender binary
 In one study analyzing sexual identities described as alternative terms for bisexual or bi-self labels, "half of all bisexual and bisexual-identified respondents also chose alternative self-labels such as "queer", "pansexual", "pansensual," "polyfidelitous," "ambisexual," "polysexual," or personalized identities such as 'byke' or 'biphilic'"
 are being used in place of the term "bisexual" because "bisexuality, it's been claimed, is a gender binary, and therefore oppressive, word" and that "the great debate is being perpetuated and developed by bisexual-identified transgender and genderqueer people on the one hand, and non-bi-identified transgender and genderqueer people on the other
 A transgender identity opens up a gender continuum rather than a gender binary rubric, but does not discard or disregard the idea of gender altogether
 "Pansexual" is derived from the word "pansexualism", dated back to 1917, which is the view "that the sex instinct plays the primary part in all human activity, mental and physical"
The definition of pansexuality can encourage the belief that it is the only sexual identity that covers individuals who do not cleanly fit into the categories of male or man, or female or woman
 The Bisexual Resource Center, for example, defines bisexuality as "an umbrella term for people who recognize and honor their potential for sexual and emotional attraction to more than one gender", while the American Institute of Bisexuality states that the term "bisexual" "is an open and inclusive term for many kinds of people with same-sex and different-sex attractions" and that "the scientific classification "bisexual" only addresses the physical, biological sex of the people involved, not the gender-presentation
The term "pansexuality" is sometimes used interchangeably with "bisexuality", and, similarly, people who identify as bisexual may "feel that gender, biological sex, and sexual orientation should not be a focal point in potential [romantic/sexual] relationships"
" The institute argues that heterosexuality and homosexuality, by contrast, "are defined by the boundary of two sexes/genders
 Because pansexual people are open to relationships with people who do not identify as strictly men or women, and pansexuality therefore rejects the gender binary, the "notion of two genders and indeed of specific sexual orientations", it is often considered a more inclusive term than "bisexual"
 Volume 2 of Cavendish's "Sex and Society", however, states that "although the term's literal meaning can be interpreted as 'attracted to everything,' people who identify as pansexual do not include paraphilias, such as bestiality, pedophilia, and necrophilia, in their definition" and that they "stress that the term pansexuality describes only consensual adult sexual behaviors"
Pansexuality may be considered a sexual orientation in its own right or a subset of bisexuality, to indicate an alternative sexual identity
A literal dictionary definition of "bisexuality", due to the prefix ', is sexual or romantic attraction to two sexes (males and females), or to two genders (men and women)
 Gender is considered more complex than the state of one's sex, as gender includes genetic, hormonal, environmental and social factors
 It is generally considered a more inclusive term than bisexual"
Compared with bisexuality and other sexual identities
The American Institute of Bisexuality argues that "terms like "pansexual", "polysexual", "omnisexual", and "ambisexual" also describe a person with homosexual and heterosexual attractions, and therefore people with those labels are also bisexual" and that "by replacing the prefix bi – (two, both) with pan- (all), poly- (many), omni- (all), ambi- (both, and implying ambiguity in this case), people who adopt these labels seek to clearly express the fact that gender does not factor into their own sexuality," but "this does not mean, however, that people who identify as bisexual are fixated on gender
 Pansexuality, however, composed with the prefix ', is the sexual attraction to a person of any sex or gender
 The term "fluid" may indicate that "a person's homosexual and heterosexual attractions exists in a state of flux and changes over time
] The Latin prefix bi- does indeed indicate two or both, however the 'both' indicated in the word bisexual are merely "homosexual" (lit
 Polysexuality is similar to pansexuality in definition, meaning "encompassing more than one sexuality," but not necessarily encompassing all sexualities
Pansexuality, or omnisexuality, is sexual attraction, romantic love, or emotional attraction toward people of any sex or gender identity
 Traditional thought employs the prefixes "hetero-" (opposite), "homo-" (same), "bi-" (two) and "trans-" ('across')
The prefix ' comes from an Ancient Greek term meaning "all" or "every"
The conceptualization of "pansexuality" as distinct from "pansexualism" contrasts with predominant prefixes attached to the "-sexual" and "-gender" roots

 It is sometimes referred to by the title "Song of the Night" (German: "Lied der Nacht"), which Mahler never knew and certainly would never have sanctioned Although the symphony is often described as being in the key of E minor, its tonal scheme is more complicated

The movement is in sonata form
 Nor does Mahler intend a euphonium, which in German is called either 'Euphonium' or 'Baryton'
The fourth movement (the second "Nachtmusik") contrasts with the first in that it illustrates a more intimate and "human" scene
 The abundance of themes based upon the interval of a fourth has parallels with the First Chamber Symphony
 He then worked on the Seventh intensively the following summer, claiming to take just four weeks to complete the first, third and fifth movements
 After this section plays itself out, a harp glissando propels the music into a new section based on the second theme and the march/chorale theme
 The trio contrasts with this, and more reflects the intimate mood that would be expected from a Viennese serenade
The harmonic and stylistic structure of the piece may be viewed as a depiction of the journey from dusk till dawn
Mahler's specification of a 'Tenorhorn' in the scoring of this work has often caused confusion
The lengthy and dramatically intense first movement is followed by three distinct pictures of night: two movements entitled "Nachtmusik," or "night music," and a "shadowy" scherzo in between them
 There are many strange and abrupt interruptions of climactic buildups, including at the very end of the coda
 Mahler, who described the movement in vague terms, compared it to Rembrandt's painting "The Night Watch," though he did not intend to evoke the painting itself
The three years which elapsed between the completion of the score and the symphony's premiere witnessed dramatic changes in Mahler's life and career
 But before a climax can be articulated, the final cadence is interrupted by the music from the introduction and the Baritone horn arioso
 <score vorbis="1"> \relative c' </score> This section has been interpreted as a "religious vision
 The scherzo is contrasted by a warmer trio in the major mode, introduced by and containing a "shrieking" motif beginning in the oboes and descending through the orchestra
 If the first "Nachtmusik" possessed a friendly mood disguised in grotesqueries, this movement is a demon sneering at the listener
 It remained for a while as one of Mahler's least appreciated works, often accused of incoherence
 More recently, scholars and conductors have experimented with a range of interpretations of the work, especially the tempo of the finale, and the work has thrilled more audiences worldwide and has since become more popular
This leads straight into the development, which continues for some time before suddenly being interrupted by pianissimo trumpet fanfares and a slow chorale based on the march theme from the introduction
 <score vorbis="1"> \relative c" </score> The movement begins with a strange gesture: a pianissimo dialogue between timpani and pizzicato basses and cellos with sardonic interjections from the winds
 The movement (and therefore the symphony) ends in a very strange way; a seemingly random stray G-sharp changes the harmonic quality from major to augmented, the music suddenly drops to piano before a stubborn fff c major chord ends the work

 Pérez de Arteaga points out, this movement is really "a most morbid and sarcastic mockery of the Viennese waltz"
 The exposition is wrapped up with a march theme from the introduction, which is followed by a repeat of the principal theme
 Musicologists surmise that this is why the optimism and cheerfulness of the symphony was subsequently tempered by the small but significant revisions Mahler made in the years leading up to its premiere
 The texture is, for the most part, based on a banal descending broken scale motif
The first of the two "Nachtmusik" ("Night Music") movements is said to represent a "Nachtwanderung" ("walk by night")"
The recapitulation is very similar to the exposition, although it is significantly more agitated
 <score vorbis="1"> \relative c </score> The long, arduous first movement, after three shorter movements developmental in mood, is finally equalled by a substantial "daylight" finale
 There is a grand pause during the first thematic section that leads into a massive climax
 The horns introduce a rich, somewhat bucolic (A) theme, surrounded by dancing strings and a march rhythm from his song "Revelge"
The piece has several motifs in common with the Sixth Symphony, notably the juxtaposition of major with minor chords, the march figure of the first movement, and the use of cowbells within certain "pastoral" episodes
Boisterous timpani joined by blazing brass set the scene for the riotous fifth movement
(E minor, beginning B minor)
In 1904, Mahler was enjoying great international success as a conductor, but he was also, at last, beginning to enjoy international success as a composer
 The principal theme, presented by horns in unison in E minor, is accompanied similarly, though much faster and in a higher register
 The piece evolves from uncertain and hesitant beginnings to an unequivocal C major finale, with its echoes of Wagner's "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg": indeed, at the premiere the overture to this opera was performed after the symphony
 With its "amoroso" marking and reduced instrumentation (trombones, tuba and trumpets are silent and the woodwinds are reduced by half) this movement has been described as "a long stretch of chamber music set amidst this huge orchestral work"
The duration of the symphony is around 80 minutes
 <score vorbis="1"> \relative c' </score> This theme leads to some confusion about the key, as it switches between C major and C minor every few beats
 In fact, the principal trumpet for the work's premiere even confronted Mahler, saying "I'd just like to know what's beautiful about blowing away at a trumpet stopped up to high C-sharp" Mahler had no answer, but later pointed out to Alma that the man did not understand the agony of his own existence
The opening horn theme of the second movement is well known in Britain since its use in an advert for Castrol GTX oil in the early eighties
This journey from night to day proceeds via an extraordinary third movement scherzo, marked "schattenhaft" (shadowy), which may have been what prompted Arnold Schoenberg to become a particular champion of the work
 After some buildup, the orchestra sets off on a threatening waltz, complete with unearthly woodwind shrieks and ghostly shimmerings from the basses, with a recurring "lamenting" theme in the woodwinds
 Overall, the movement possesses a grotesque quality, but always with friendly intentions
 The march theme from the introduction leads straight into an epic coda that features march rhythms and multiple high points in the orchestral texture, before ending on an E major chord
 One remarkable aspect of the movement is its symmetrical form; it is a rondo following the structure (I)-(A)-(B)-(I/A)-(C)-(I/A)-(B)-(A)-(I), where (I) is an introductory section and (I/A) combines the introductory music and the (A) theme
" It has also been asserted that this section contains the chains of fourths that impressed Arnold Schoenberg
 At one memorable point in the score, the strings are instructed to play pizzicato with the volume "fffff", with the footnote, "pluck so hard that the strings hit the wood
 Little wonder that, of all the Symphony's movements, this has come in for the greatest amount of criticism and puzzlement
 Cowbells from the first "Nachtmusik" and the "unpitched low bells" from Mahler's sixth symphony also make appearances
 It has been seen by many as something of a let-down and somewhat superficial, dodging questions set by the previous movements; its virtually unrelenting mood of celebration seems quite at odds with the dark character of the earlier movements
 The movement is a rondo combined with a set of eight variations, capped off by a dramatic coda

 His second daughter was born that June, and during his customary summer break away from Vienna in his lakeside retreat at Maiernigg in the Carinthian Mountains, he finished the Sixth Symphony and sketched the second and fourth movements (the two "Nachtmusik" movements) for the Seventh Symphony while mapping out much of the rest of the work

 Multiple viola solos rise above the texture, and there is a persistent timpani-pizzicato motif that pervades the dance
Mahler conducted the premiere of his Seventh Symphony in Prague in 1908. A few weeks later he conducted it in Munich and the Netherlands
 Thus, as Dika Newlin has pointed out, "in this symphony Mahler returns to the ideal of 'progressive tonality' which he had abandoned in the Sixth"
 The rural mood is heightened by a gentle, rustic dance for the (B) section - typical of Mahler at his most carefree and childlike - as well as by the gentle clanking of distant cow-bells in the returns of the introductory section
The brilliance of this movement lies in its extroardinary and original orchestration, which gives this movement a strongly nightmarish quality
 The complexity of the work's tonal scheme was analysed in terms of 'interlocking structures' by Graham George
 "A vigorous life-asserting pageant of Mahlerian blatancy", is how Michael Kennedy describes it, and Mahler himself explained it with the aperçu "The world is mine!" The principal theme of the first movement crops up amidst the outrageously exuberant finale, but is soon quelled and reappears in the major mode
Gustav Mahler's Seventh Symphony was written in 1904–05, with repeated revisions to the scoring
 In Britain, the name 'tenor horn' is often given to the instrument that in the US is called the alto horn (in E or F); in Germany this (a contralto saxhorn) is known as the Althorn in E or F, and is not the instrument requested by Mahler
The symphony is scored for the following orchestra
 The symphony's first movement moves from B minor (introduction) to E minor, and the work ends with a Rondo-Finale in C major
 Both the audience and the performers at the premiere were confused by the work, and it was not well received
Andante amoroso (F major)
 The movement progresses through a series of marches and dances and naturalistic nocturnal descriptions
 Scampering woodwinds imitating somewhat grotesque bird calls pass off into the distance, as the trumpets sound the major-minor seal from the sixth symphony
 At one point the violins reach an F#7, the highest F# on the piano
 The theme and its accompaniment are both passed around the orchestra rather than being played by a specific instrument
 The malicious (C) theme, upon its return, is arabesqued by the Revelge rhythms and bird calls from earlier in the movement
 As in some of his other symphonies (particularly his 5th, 6th symphonies), Mahler's interest in unconventional instruments in the orchestra is clearly shown in the scoring in this work, with usage of a tenor horn, cowbells, mandolin, and guitar
 The is actually a B instrument similar to the instrument known in Britain and the USA as the baritone horn
 It begins with a slow introduction in B minor, launched by a dark melody played by a baritone horn
The completed score was dated 15 August 1905, and the orchestration was finished in 1906; he laid the Seventh aside to make small changes to the orchestration of the Sixth, while rehearsing for its premiere in May 1906.

 The area of many-body physics devotes considerable effort to quantum-mechanical screening, which is very relevant to condensed matter physics
The first theoretical treatment of screening, due to Debye and Hückel, dealt with a stationary point charge embedded in a fluid
 We thus approximate "T" by the kinetic energy of an additional electron in the free electron gas, which is simply the Fermi energy "EF"
 This energy may be decomposed into a kinetic energy "T" part and the potential energy -"eφ" part
 At each point in space, the density of electrons with energy "j" has the form
 In physics this is known as Friedel oscillations, and applies both to surface and bulk screening
 The associated charge density is "Qδ"("r"), where "δ"("r") is the Dirac delta function
 After the system has returned to equilibrium, let the change in the electron density and electric potential be "Δρ"("r") and "Δφ"("r") respectively
 This is related to the Gibbs phenomenon, where fourier series for functions that vary rapidly in space are not good approximations unless a very large number of terms in the series are retained
Debye–Hückel approximation
 Each electron possesses a negative charge
 Therefore, the Fermi-Thomas approximation is only valid when the electron density is low, so that the particle interactions are relatively weak
 Only at short distances, inside the hole region, can the electron's field be detected
where "kB" is Boltzmann's constant
In a fluid, with a given relative dielectric constant "εR", composed of electrically charged constituent particles, each pair of particles interact through the Coulomb force,
 This is because Fermi-Thomas theory assumes that the mobile charges (electrons) can respond at any wave-vector
For example, consider a fluid composed of electrons in a background of positive charge
In physics, screening is the damping of electric fields caused by the presence of mobile charge carriers
 In condensed matter physics, this model is referred to as jellium
is called the Fermi-Thomas screening wave vector
 At first, the electrons are evenly distributed so that there is zero net charge at every point
Inserting this into the above equation for "Δμ" yields
 This is known as electrostatic screening
We now introduce a fixed point charge "Q" at the origin
 The Debye length is the fundamental length scale of a classical plasma
To proceed, we must find a second independent equation relating "Δρ" and "Δφ"
 In each case the net electric field does not fall off exponentially in space, but rather as an inverse power law multiplied by an oscillatory term
 Viewed from a large distance, this screening hole has the effect of an overlaid positive charge which cancels the electric field produced by the electron
Perturbing to first order, we find that
 This flow reduces the "effective" interaction between particles to a short-range "screened" Coulomb interaction
 We consider two possible approximations, under which the two quantities are proportional: the Debye-Hückel approximation, valid at high temperatures, and the Fermi-Thomas approximation, valid at low temperatures
This interaction complicates the theoretical treatment of the fluid
 Note that this potential has the same form as the Yukawa potential
 It is a Coulomb potential multiplied by an exponential damping term, with the strength of the damping factor given by the magnitude of "k"0, the Debye or Fermi-Thomas wave vector
Our results from the Debye-Hückel or Fermi-Thomas approximation may now be inserted into the first Maxwell equation
 It is an important part of the behavior of charge-carrying fluids, such as ionized gases (classical plasmas), electrolytes, and electronic conductors (semiconductors, metals)
The associated length λD ≡ 1/"k"0 is called the Debye length
 (The former condition corresponds, in a real experiment, to keeping the fluid in electrical contact at a fixed potential difference with ground
 According to Coulomb's interaction, negative charges repel each other
In the Fermi-Thomas approximation, the system is maintained at a constant electron chemical potential (Fermi level) and at low temperature
which is called a screened Coulomb potential
In real metals, electrical screening is more complex than described above in the Fermi-Thomas theory
 Since the chemical potential is kept constant,
In reality, these long-range effects are suppressed by the flow of the fluid particles in response to electric fields
 Consequently, this electron will repel other electrons creating a small region around itself in which there are fewer electrons
 This is permissible since the electrons are lighter and more mobile than the ions, provided we consider distances much larger than the ionic separation
 For simplicity, we ignore the motion and spatial distribution of the ions, approximating them as a uniform background charge
 The difficulty lies in the fact that even though the Coulomb force diminishes with distance as 1/"r"², the average number of particles at each distance "r" is proportional to "r"², assuming the fluid is fairly isotropic
Screened Coulomb interactions
This follows from a previous result for the free electron gas, which is a model of non-interacting electrons, whereas the fluid which we are studying contains a Coulomb interaction
 This screening yields a dielectric function formula_13.
Electric-field screening
 However, it is not energetically possible for an electron within or on a Fermi surface to respond at wave-vectors shorter than the Fermi wave-vector
Let "ρ" denote the number density of electrons, and "φ" the electric potential
 The charge density and electric potential are related by the first of Maxwell's equations, which gives
Electrostatic screening
In the Debye–Hückel approximation, we maintain the system in thermodynamic equilibrium, at a temperature "T" high enough that the fluid particles obey Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics
If the temperature is extremely low, the behavior of the electrons comes close to the quantum mechanical model of a free electron gas
Fermi-Thomas approximation
 The Fermi energy is related to the density of electrons (including spin degeneracy) by
 This region can be treated as a positively charged "screening hole"
 Therefore, "φ" is initially a constant as well
 Perturbing in "φ" and expanding the exponential to first order, we obtain
which is known as the screened Poisson equation
 As a result, a charge fluctuation at any one point has non-negligible effects at large distances
 For example, a naive quantum mechanical calculation of the ground-state energy density yields infinity, which is unreasonable
Consider a fluid of electrons in a background of heavy, positively charged ions
) The chemical potential "μ" is, by definition, the energy of adding an extra electron to the fluid

 In 2006, the 9th Circuit Appeals Court subsequently overturned Rosenthal's conviction
 With the passage of California's pioneering Proposition 215 in 1996, which authorizes medicinal use of marijuana, he worked with the state and local governments to implement the delivery of pharmaceutical-grade cannabis to patients with a doctor's recommendation to use marijuana
Ed Rosenthal (born Bronx, New York, 1944) is a California horticulturist, author, publisher, and "Cannabis" grower known for his advocacy for the legalization of marijuana use

 The mantle is a roughly pear-shaped mesh made of fabric placed over the burner
 Mantle lamps are considerably brighter than flat- or round-wick lamps, produce a whiter light and generate more heat
The hot-blast design, also known as a "tubular lantern" due to the metal tubes used in its construction, was invented by John Irwin and patented on January 12, 1868. The hot-blast design collected hot air from above the globe and fed it through metal side tubes to the burner, to make the flame burn brighter
 The "Lamp Oil" must not be liquid Parafin
The cold-blast design is similar to the hot-blast, except that cold fresh air is drawn in from around the top of the globe and is then fed though the metal side tubes to the flame, making it burn brighter
 Later made from petroleum, kerosene became a popular lighting fuel
 Kerosene lamps have a wick or mantle as light source, protected by a glass chimney or globe; lamps may be used on a table, or hand-held lanterns may be used for portable lighting
 Vapors from spilled fuel may ignite; vapor trapped above liquid fuel may lead to excess pressure and fires
 A flat-wick lamp has a fuel tank (fount), with the lamp burner attached
 Kerosene lamps are still extensively used in areas without electrical lighting; the cost and dangers of combustion lighting are a continuing concern in many countries
Mantle lamps are nearly always bright enough to benefit from a lampshade and a few mantle lamps may be enough to heat a small building in cold weather
 Such liquids are dangerous and should not be used in a Kerosene lamp or lantern
 Adjusting how much of the wick extends above the wick tube controls the flame
 The wick rides in between the inner and outer wick tubes; the inner wick tube (central draft tube) provides the "central draft" or draft that supplies air to the flame spreader
 Attached to the fuel tank, four prongs hold the glass chimney, which acts to prevent the flame from being blown out and enhances a thermally induced draft
 Kerosene lanterns meant for portable use have a flat wick and are made in dead flame, hot blast, and cold blast variants
Later lanterns such as the Hot Blast and Cold Blast lanterns took this airflow control even further by partially enclosing the wick in a "deflector" or "burner cone" and channeling the airflow through that restricted area creating a brighter and even more stable flame
 Liquid Parafin based "Lamp Oil" should only be used in flat wick lamps with a wick diameter of less than 5/8"
A central draught lamp, or Argand lamp, works in the same manner as the flat wick lamp
 The mantle typically contains thorium or other rare-earth salts; on first use the cloth burns away and the rare-earth salts are converted to oxides, leaving a very fragile structure which incandesces (glows brightly) upon exposure to the heat of the burner flame
 They produce more light per unit of fuel than wick-type lamps, but are more complex and expensive in construction, and more complex to operate
Kerosene lamps are widely used for lighting in rural areas of Africa and Asia where electricity is not distributed, or is too costly
 Kerosene lamps consume an estimated 77 billion litres of fuel per year, equivalent to 1.3 million barrels of oil per day, comparable to annual U
 There are three types of kerosene lamp: flat wick, central draught (tubular round wick), and mantle lamp
Any liquid with a low flash point presents a high risk of fire or explosion if used in a kerosene wick lamp
Round wick, center draft lamps, must only burn either "Klean Heat" or "Low Odor Mineral Spirits"
A variation on the "central draught" lamp is the mantle lamp
One popular model of mantle lamp uses only a wick and is unpressurized
 In some locations they sell Red kerosene which is dyed red and is slightly less expensive than K-1 kerosene, as no motor-fuel taxes are collected on it
 Used in larger wicks and the wicks become clogged and must be discarded
 Vapor from the gas generator burns, heating a mantle to incandescence and also providing heat to the gas generator
 The tubular wick is then mounted into a "carrier," which is some form of a toothed rack that engages into the gears of the wick-raising mechanism of the burner and allows the wick to be raised and lowered
 If this type of lamp is broken it can easily start a fire
The first description of a simple lamp using crude mineral oil was provided by al-Razi (Rhazes) in 9th century Baghdad, who referred to it as the "naffatah" in his "Kitab al-Asrar" ("Book of Secrets")
 If the wick is too high, and extends beyond the burner cone at the top of the wick tube, the lamp will produce smoke and soot (unburned carbon)
 As the kerosene burns, capillary action in the wick draws more kerosene up from the fuel tank
 The lower part of the wick dips into the fount and absorbs the kerosene; the top part of the wick extends out of the wick tube of the lamp burner, which includes a wick-adjustment mechanism
 Mantle lamps typically use fuel faster than a flat wick lamp, but slower than a center-draught round wick as they depend on a small flame heating a mantle, rather than having all the light coming from the flame itself
 A hand-pump pressurizes air, which forces liquid fuel from a reservoir into a gas generator
 Both hot blast and cold blast designs are called tubular lanterns and are safer than dead flame lamps as tipping over a tubular lantern cuts off the oxygen flow to the burner and will extinguish the flame within seconds
 The burner uses a wick, usually made of cotton, that is made of a wide, flat wick rolled into a tube, the seam of which is then stitched together to form the complete wick
 "Klean-Heat" brand is another highly refined fuel cleaner-burning, nicer-smelling kerosene substitute, sold at many hardware stores during winter
 jet fuel consumption of 76 billion litres per year
The lamp burner has a flat wick, usually made of cotton
 Red dyed kerosene is not recommended as the dye will gradually clog the lantern wick causing odor and reduced performance
 A lamp set too high will burn off its soot harmlessly if quickly turned down, but if not caught soon enough the soot itself can ignite and a "runaway lamp" condition can result
 Adjustment is usually done by means of a small knob operating a cric, which is a toothed, metal sprocket bearing against the wick
 Such fuels may produce additional smoke and odor and may not be usable indoors
 The wick tube surrounds the wick, and ensures that the correct amount of air reaches the lamp burner
 When the lamp is lit, the central draft tube supplies air to the flame spreader that spreads out the flame into a ring of fire and allows the lamp to burn cleanly
 1 diesel fuel (also called winter diesel) is about the same as kerosene but with the additives to make it a motor fuel
Contamination of lamp fuel with even a small amount of gasoline results in a lower flash point and higher vapor pressure for the fuel, with potentially dangerous consequences
Pressurized mantle lamps contain a gas generator and require preheating the generator before lighting
A flat-wick lamp is a simple type of kerosene lamp, which burns kerosene drawn up through a wick by capillary action
A kerosene lamp (usually called a paraffin lamp in some countries) is a type of lighting device that uses kerosene (paraffin) as a fuel
 Citronella oil is a citronella-scented lamp oil; some brands also have lemongrass oil in them and they are used for their insect repellent properties
 Citronella and lemongrass fuels should only be used outdoors
Large fixed pressurized kerosene mantle lamps were used in lighthouse beacons for navigation of ships, brighter and with lower fuel consumption than oil lamps used before
 This design produces a brighter light than the hot blast design, because the fresh air that is fed to the flame has plenty of oxygen to support the combustion process
 This had the effect of removing side-to-side drafts and thus significantly reducing or even eliminating the flickering that can occur with an exposed flame
 Although more expensive, Lamp oil is highly refined and burns more cleanly and with less odor than kerosene
 Like flat- and round-wick lamps, they can be adjusted for brightness; however, caution must be used, because if set too high the lamp chimney and the mantle can become covered with black areas of soot
 An air pump is used to deliver fuel under pressure to the gas generator
A kerosene lantern, also known as a "barn lantern" or "hurricane lantern," is a flat-wick lamp made for portable and outdoor use
The earliest portable kerosene "glass globe" lanterns, of the 1850s and 60s, were of the dead-flame type meaning that it had an open wick, but the airflow to the flame was strictly controlled in an upward motion by a combination of vents at the bottom of the burner and an open topped chimney
 In 1846 Abraham Pineo Gesner invented a substitute for whale oil for lighting, distilled from coal
 The glass chimney needs a "throat," or slight constriction, to create the proper draft for complete combustion of the fuel; the draft carries more air (oxygen) past the flame, helping to produce a smokeless light which is brighter than an open flame would produce
 The burner is equipped with a tall glass chimney, of around 12 inches tall or taller, to provide the powerful draft this lamp requires to burn properly
 There are three types: Dead flame, hot blast, and cold blast
 A kerosene lamp producing 37 lumens for 4 hours per day will consume about 3 litres of kerosene per month
Central draft (tubular round wick) lamp
 Like oil lamps, they are useful for lighting without electricity, such as in regions without rural electrification, in electrified areas during power outages, at campsites, and on boats
 Modern versions of the kerosene lamp were later constructed by the Polish inventor Ignacy Łukasiewicz in 1853 Lviv
Flat wick-type lamps have the lowest light output, Center Draft round wick lamps have 3 - 4 times the output of flat wick lamps and pressurized lamps have higher output yet; the range is from 8 to 100 lumens
Flat wick Kerosene wick lamps should only be operated with kerosene, lamp oil or "Klean Heat", but alternative fuels are used in an emergency
 When the lamp is lit, the kerosene that the wick has absorbed burns and produces a clear, bright, yellow flame
 Tractor vaporizing oil is made from kerosene with some additive to make a motor fuel for tractors
Pressurized kerosene lamps have a gas generator and gas mantle; these are known as Petromax, Tilley lamps, or Coleman lamps, among other manufacturers
 They are made of soldered or crimped-together sheet metal stampings, with tin-plated sheet steel being the most common material, followed by brass and copper
 All kerosene flat wick lamps use the dead flame burner design, where the flame is fed cold air from below and hot air exits above
 Jet A jet-engine fuel is essentially kerosene with a few additives
 Mantle lamps, because of the higher temperature at which they operate, do not produce much odor, except when first lit or extinguished
Generic lamp oil is available clear or in a choice of several colors and in scented and unscented forms
 "Water clear" K-1 kerosene is the next grade of preferred fuel for kerosene wick lamps

 The school expanded its programs, including a film program in 1973. The school moved to the Hillside Campus in Pasadena in 1976. The school operated Art Center Europe in La Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland from 1986 to 1996. In 2003, ArtCenter was granted Non-Governmental Organization status by the UN Department of Public Information
 Most recently, the growing influence of ArtCenter's Film programs resulted in the college's ranking among "The Hollywood Reporter's" list of the Top 25 Global Film Schools
 The Wind Tunnel has hosted events including the biannual Art Center Design Conference, like 2006's "Radical Craft" and 2008's "Serious Play"; an annual Summit on Sustainable Mobility; large exhibitions such as "Supersonic: 1 Wind Tunnel, 8 Schools, 120 Artists", "Gardenlab", and "Open House: Architecture and Technology for Intelligent Living" (with Vitra Design Museum); and various community meetings and events
 Opening in 1976, the building was later expanded with the south wing, designed by former Ellwood associate James Tyler, and constructed between 1989-91. The Hillside Campus houses classrooms and studio space, multiple computer labs, the James Lemont Fogg Memorial Library, a model shop with traditional tools as well as rapid prototyping technologies (multi-axis CNC, laser-cutting, and multiple types of 3D printing), painting facilities, the Color, Material, and Trends Exploration Lab (CMTEL), an (Auto) Interior Simulation Lab, the Sinclaire Pavilion, photo and film stages with printing and editing facilities, as well as a curated student gallery and an external exhibit gallery, both open to the public

The college logo is an orange circle, also known as the ArtCenter "Dot," which has been a part of the school's identity since its inception by founder Tink Adams and a small number of colleagues
Art Center College of Design
 The Hillside Campus has been designated as a historic monument by the City of Pasadena
 ArtCenter opened the South Campus in Pasadena in 2004.
 In 1947, the post-war boom in students caused the school to expand to a larger location in the building of the former Cumnock School for Girls in the Hancock Park neighborhood, while still maintaining a presence at its original downtown location
 To help prevent this, denatonium is often added to give the substance an extremely bitter flavor
Despite its poisonous content, denatured alcohol is sometimes consumed as a surrogate alcohol, which can result in blindness or death if (as was typical) it contains methanol
In the United States, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), formerly known as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), regulates sales of alcoholic beverages
Denatured alcohol is used identically to ethanol itself except for applications that involve ingestion
 Rather, the ethanol is mixed with other chemicals to form an undrinkable solution
 The main additive has traditionally been 10% methanol, giving rise to the term "methylated spirits"
 The process creates an ethanol-containing solution that is not suitable for drinking, but is otherwise similar to ethanol for most purposes
 Methanol is commonly used both because its boiling point is close to that of ethanol and because it is toxic
There are several grades of denatured alcohol, but in general the denaturants used are similar
 In some cases it is also dyed
Denatured alcohol provides a solution to permit legitimate use and manufacture of ethanol, whereby cheap ethanol can be made available for non-consumption use without the risk of its being converted for consumption
 As a consequence, its composition is tightly defined by government regulations that vary between countries
The European Union agreed in February 2013 to the mutual procedures for the complete denaturing of alcohol:
 Denatured alcohol and its manufacture are a public policy compromise
 Alcoholic beverages (liquor, wine, beer, etc
Denatured alcohol is not, in itself, a preferred product — that is, it is not something that would be normally demanded if given the alternative of normal ethanol
 If pure ethanol were made cheaply available for fuel, solvents, or medicinal purposes, some people might ingest it
 In order to avoid paying beverage taxes on alcohol that is not meant to be consumed, the alcohol must be denatured per specific formulations given by the TTB
 There are approximately 50 formulations provided by the TTB, most of which are indeed toxic to humans, but not all
Different additives are used to make it difficult to use distillation or other simple processes to reverse the denaturation
 As an example, the formulation for "completely denatured alcohol", according to 2005 British regulations was as follows:
and 0.5 parts by volume of crude pyridine, and to the resulting mixture add mineral naphtha (petroleum oil) in the proportion of 3.75 litres to every 1000 litres of the mixture and synthetic organic dyestuff (methyl violet) in the proportion of 1.5 grams to every 1000 litres of the mixture
 Often the denatured alcohol is dyed with methyl violet
 As a result, there is no duty on denatured alcohol in most countries, making it considerably cheaper than pure ethanol
Another typical denaturant is pyridine
 For instance, during American prohibition, Federal law required methanol in domestically manufactured industrial alcohols
 Substances such as pyridine help to give the mixture an unpleasant odor, and emetic (vomiting) agents such as syrup of ipecac may also be included
Completely denatured alcohol must be made in accordance with the following formulation: with every 90 parts by volume of alcohol mix 9.5 parts by volume of wood naphtha or a substitute
 Other typical additives include isopropyl alcohol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, and denatonium
 Un-denatured ethanol is required for food and beverage applications and certain chemical reactions where the denaturant would interfere
 On Christmas Day 1926 and the two following days, roughly at the midpoint of the "Great Experiment" of prohibition, 31 people in New York City died of methanol poisoning
Denatured alcohol is used as a solvent and as fuel for alcohol burners and camping stoves
 For many of these solutions, there is no practical way to separate the components
Consumption and toxicity
New Zealand has removed methanol from its government-approved "methylated spirits" formulation
Denatured alcohol, also called methylated spirits, is ethanol that has additives to make it poisonous, extremely bad tasting, foul smelling or nauseating, to discourage recreational consumption
 Because of the diversity of industrial uses for denatured alcohol, hundreds of additives and denaturing methods have been used
Denaturing alcohol does not chemically alter the ethanol molecule
 Labels such as "cannot be made nonpoisonous" communicate to users that they should not trust any alcohol claiming to be rendered safe by distilling, filtering, or additives
 The supply and demand for denatured alcohol arises from the fact that normal alcohol (which in everyday language refers specifically to ethanol, suitable for human ingestion as a recreational drink or extractive medium for medicinal tinctures) is usually very expensive in comparison with similar chemicals, being highly taxed for revenue and public health policy purposes (see Pigovian tax)
 The British had long feared that it would be used as a staging post to launch a French invasion of Britain
Many French residents of what are now Canada's Maritime provinces, called Acadians, were deported during the Great Expulsion (1755–63)
 The 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle had allowed more generous terms, and France had constructed greater defences for the town
 While the war had weakened France, it was still a European Power
 Spain ceded Florida to Britain
 In turn France gained the return of its sugar colony, Guadeloupe, which it considered more valuable than Canada
 However, France needed peace to rebuild
France ceded all of its territory in mainland North America, but retained fishing rights off Newfoundland and the two small islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, where it could dry that fish
The article provided for unrestrained emigration for 18 months from Canada
 However, the judge was British and his opinion on French law could be limited or hostile
 For decades following the Seven Years' War, Frederick II would consider the Treaty of Paris as a British betrayal
By the Treaty Britain forced France to accept the earlier 1713 conditions and demolish the fortifications they had constructed since then
The American colonists were disappointed by the protection of Roman Catholicism in the Treaty of Paris because of their own strong Protestant faith
 This was limited by royal prerogative, and the monarch could still choose to change the accepted laws in a conquered colony
 Some have pointed to this as one reason for the breakdown of American–British relations
 New Orleans on the east side remained in French hands (albeit temporarily)
 In the treaty, most of these territories were restored to their original owners
 In return, France ceded Canada, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tobago to Britain
The 1763 treaty states in Article VII:
 However, they were no longer welcome in English Nova Scotia
 French diplomats believed that without France to keep the Americans in check, the colonists might attempt to revolt
George III agreed to allow Catholicism within the laws of Great Britain
 Also, Britain did not want French settlers to leave Canada to strengthen other French settlements in North America
 The peace was inadequate, because the places gained were no equivalent for the places surrendered
 Despite a desire for peace, many in the British parliament opposed the return of any gains made during the war
 This was relaxed in Quebec to some degree, but top positions like governorships were still held by Anglicans
 Britain however made considerable gains
 However, the treaty eliminated this power because by a different constitutional principle, terms of a treaty were considered paramount
 After the signing of the peace treaty guaranteed some rights to Roman Catholics, some Acadians returned to Canada
 Commander-in-Chief of the British Jeffrey Amherst noted that, "Many of the Canadians consider their Colony to be of utmost consequence to France & cannot be convinced … that their Country has been conceded to Great Britain"
 In addition, while France regained its factories in India, France recognized British clients as the rulers of key Indian native states, and pledged not to send troops to Bengal
 After a long debate in Britain of the relative merits of Guadeloupe, which produced £6 million a year in sugar, versus Canada which was expensive to keep, Britain decided to keep Canada for strategic reasons and return Guadeloupe to France
 If the case was appealed to a superior court, neither French law nor Roman Catholic jurors were allowed
During the war, Britain had conquered the French colonies of Canada, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Lucia, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tobago, the French "factories" (trading posts) in India, the slave-trading station at Gorée, the Sénégal River and its settlements, and the Spanish colonies of Manila (in the Philippines) and Havana (in Cuba)
 However, passage of British ships was expensive
 Some have claimed that this was part of British policy to limit emigration
 Notable among the opposition was former Prime Minister William Pitt, the Elder, who warned that the terms of the treaty would only lead to further conflicts once France and Spain had time to rebuild
 "The peace was insecure," he would later say, "because it restored the enemy to her former greatness
 France and Spain restored all their conquests to Britain and Portugal
Though the Protestant British feared Roman Catholics, Britain did not want to antagonize France through expulsion or forced conversion
The Treaty of Paris, also known as the Treaty of 1763, was signed on 10 February 1763 by the kingdoms of Great Britain, France and Spain, with Portugal in agreement, after Britain's victory over France and Spain during the Seven Years' War
The French people of Quebec felt great betrayal at the French concession
 Britain restored Manila and Havana to Spain, and Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Lucia, Gorée, and the Indian factories to France
 In what Winston Churchill would later term a policy of "appeasement," Bute returned some colonies to Spain and France in the negotiations
 Additionally, Britain agreed to protect Roman Catholicism in the New World
 This explains why Britain agreed to return so much while being in such a strong position
 Britain agreed to demolish its fortifications in British Honduras (now Belize), but retained a logwood-cutting colony there
 The treaty did not involve Prussia and Austria as they signed a separate agreement, the Treaty of Hubertusburg, five days later
Unlike Lord Bute, the French Foreign Minister the Duke of Choiseul expected a return to war
" The treaty passed 319 votes to 65 opposed
 France had already secretly given Louisiana to Spain in the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)
Treaty of Paris (1763)
 Under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 they had forced France to concede extreme limits on the fortifications there
Exchange of territories
 This explains Britain's willingness to protect Roman Catholics living in Canada
 Britain confirmed the right of its new subjects to practice Catholicism
 However the transfer actually occurred with the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762) but was not publicly announced until 1764. The Treaty of Paris was to give Britain the east side of the Mississippi (including Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which was to be part of the British territory of West Florida)
 A total of 1,600 people left New France through the Treaty clause, but only 270 French Canadians
 Voltaire had notoriously dismissed Canada as "Quelques arpents de neige", "Some acres of snow"
 Lastly, France required protection for Roman Catholics in North America considering Britain's previous treatment of Roman Catholics under its jurisdiction
The signing of the treaty formally ended the Seven Years' War, known as the French and Indian War in the North American theatre, and marked the beginning of an era of British dominance outside Europe
The Treaty of Paris is frequently noted as the point at which France gave Louisiana to Spain
 The Mississippi River corridor in what is modern day Louisiana was to be reunited following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the Adams–Onís Treaty in 1819.
 In this period, British laws included various Test Acts to prevent governmental, judicial, and bureaucratic appointments from going to Roman Catholics
 France had captured Minorca and British trading posts in Sumatra, while Spain had captured the border fortress of Almeida in Portugal, and Colonia del Sacramento in South America
 France also ceded the eastern half of French Louisiana to Britain; that is, the area from the Mississippi River to the Appalachian Mountains
Article IV of the treaty allowed Roman Catholicism to be practised in Canada
 In practice, Roman Catholics could become jurors in inferior courts in Quebec and argue based on principles of French law
While the war was fought all over the world, the British began the war over French possessions in North America
 In Canada, France wanted open emigration for those who would not swear allegiance to the British Crown such as nobility
Article IV has also been cited as the basis for Quebec often having its unique set of laws that are different from the rest of Canada
 There was a general constitutional principle in the United Kingdom to allow colonies taken through conquest to continue their own laws
 They were forced into New Brunswick, which is a bilingual province today as a result of that relocation
The Treaty of Paris took no consideration of Great Britain's battered continental ally, Frederick II of Prussia
 This would be a continuing source of resentment to France, who would eventually have this clause overturned in the 1783 Treaty of Paris which brought an end to the American Revolutionary War
 Frederick would have to negotiate peace terms separately in the Treaty of Hubertusburg
When Lord Bute became Prime Minister in 1762, he pushed for a resolution to the war with France and Spain, fearing that Great Britain could not govern all of its newly acquired territories
 Roman Catholics were believed to be agents of the Jacobite Pretenders to the throne, who normally resided in France supported by the French regime
 British Prime Minister Lord Bute wanted a peace that would not aggravate France towards a second war
During the negotiations that led to the treaty, a major issue of dispute between Britain and France had been over the status of the fortifications of the French coastal settlement of Dunkirk
 The two nations returned much of the territory that they had each captured during the war, but Britain gained much of France's possessions in North America
Effects on French Canada
The actual geography of North America turned out not to match the details used in the treaty
 Dutch possessions in the East Indies, captured in 1781, were returned by Britain to the Netherlands in exchange for trading privileges in the Dutch East Indies, by a treaty which was not finalized until 1784.
 In the treaty with Spain, the territories of East and West Florida were ceded to Spain (without a clear northern boundary, resulting in a territorial dispute resolved by the Treaty of Madrid in 1795), as was the island of Minorca, while the Bahama Islands, Grenada, and Montserrat, captured by the French and Spanish, were returned to Britain
Treaty of Paris (1783)
On the same day, Great Britain also signed separate agreements with France and Spain, and (provisionally) with the Netherlands
 The point was the United States would become a major trading partner
The United States Congress of the Confederation ratified the Treaty of Paris on January 14, 1784. Copies were sent back to Europe for ratification by the other parties involved, the first reaching France in March 1784. British ratification occurred on April 9, 1784, and the ratified versions were exchanged in Paris on May 12, 1784. It was not for some time, though, that the Americans in the countryside received the news because of the lack of speedy communication
 While that West Florida Controversy continued, Spain used its new control of Florida to block American access to the Mississippi, in defiance of Article 8.
 The concession of the vast trans-Appalachian region was designed to facilitate the growth of the American population and create lucrative markets for British merchants, without any military or administrative costs to Britain
 The treaty with France was mostly about exchanges of captured territory (France's only net gains were the island of Tobago, and Senegal in Africa), but also reinforced earlier treaties, guaranteeing fishing rights off Newfoundland
 Some, notably Virginia, also defied Article 4 and maintained laws against payment of debts to British creditors
 As the French foreign minister Vergennes later put it, "The English buy peace rather than make it"
 The British also built an additional fort (Miami) during this time
 The Treaty specified a southern boundary for the United States, but the separate Anglo-Spanish agreement did not specify a northern boundary for Florida, and the Spanish government assumed that the boundary was the same as in the 1763 agreement by which they had first given their territory in Florida to Britain
 Its territorial provisions were "exceedingly generous" to the United States in terms of enlarged boundaries
, by confiscating Loyalist property for "unpaid debts")
" "Done at Paris, this third day of September in the year of our Lord, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three
Franklin was almost successful in getting Britain to cede the Province of Quebec (today's eastern Canada) to the United States because he hoped to control all of North America
 Representing the United States were Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, Henry Laurens, and John Adams
 David Hartley and Richard Oswald represented Great Britain
 The British at first agreed, then rejected the proposal
Peace negotiations began in April 1782, and continued through the summer
Privileges that the Americans had received from Britain automatically when they had colonial status (including protection from pirates in the Mediterranean Sea; see: the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War) were withdrawn
The Treaty of Paris, signed in Paris by representatives of King George III of Great Britain and representatives of the United States of America on September 3, 1783, ended the American Revolutionary War
 This matter was finally settled by the 1794 Jay Treaty
 Individual states ignored federal recommendations, under Article 5, to restore confiscated Loyalist property, and also ignored Article 6 (e
 They found justification for these actions in the unstable and extremely tense situation that existed in the area following the war, in the failure of the United States government to fulfill commitments made to compensate loyalists for their losses, and in the British need for time to liquidate various assets in the region
" British troops remained stationed at a number of forts (Detroit, Lernoult, Michilimackinac, Niagara, Ontario, Oswegatchie, Presque Isle) for over a decade
Historians have often commented that the treaty was very generous to the United States in terms of greatly enlarged boundaries
 Historians such as Alvord, Harlow, and Ritcheson have emphasized that British generosity was based on a statesmanlike vision of close economic ties between Britain and the United States
In the Great Lakes region, Great Britain violated the treaty stipulation that they should relinquish control of forts in United States territory "with all convenient speed
 This treaty, along with the separate peace treaties between Great Britain and the nations that supported the American cause: France, Spain and the Dutch Republic, are known collectively as the Peace of Paris
 The treaty was signed at the Hotel d'York (presently 56) in Paris on September 3, 1783 by Adams, Franklin, Jay, and Hartley
" Declares the treaty to be "in the name of the most holy and undivided Trinity", states the "bona fides" of the signatories, and declares the intention of both parties to "forget all past misunderstandings and differences" and "secure to both perpetual peace and harmony"
 The British often ignored the provision of Article 7 about removal of slaves
 Most notably, France retained all of the territory which it possessed as of 1 January 1792, and also was returned many of the territories lost to Britain during the war
 The House of Orange, which united Belgium and the Netherlands, was created to strengthen the two aforementioned countries in case of a French attack
Treaty of Paris (1814)
 The allied parties did not sign a common document, but instead concluded separate treaties with France allowing for specific amendments
To distinguish this agreement from a second treaty of Paris, concluded on 20 November 1815 as one of the treaties amending Vienna the treaty of 30 May 1814 is sometimes referred to as the First Peace of Paris
The Treaty of Paris, signed on 30 May 1814, ended the war between France and the Sixth Coalition, part of the Napoleonic Wars, following an armistice signed on 23 May between Charles, Count of Artois, and the allies
 In return, Sweden was compensated 24 million francs and this money gave rise to the Guadeloupe Fund
 France only recognised the independence of Haiti in 1838.
Effect and aftermath
 The treaty returned to Spain the territory of San Domingo that had been transferred to France by the Treaty of Basel in 1795. This implicitly recognised French sovereignty over Saint-Domingue, which Dessalines had proclaimed independent under the name of Haiti
 Many German states had been consolidated by Napoleon, and they retained this status, while Prussia gained territory in western Germany, near the border with France
 Great Britain kept sovereignty over the island of Malta
 In Italy, several different political entities were recognized, and the independence of Switzerland was formally recognized
The treaty reapportioned several territories amongst various countries
 Peace talks had started on 9 May between Talleyrand, who negotiated for the exiled Bourbon king Louis XVIII of France, and the allies of Chaumont, who had agreed to reduce France to her 1792 borders and restore the independence of her neighbors after Napoleon Bonaparte's defeat
 This provision resulted in the Congress of Vienna, held between September 1814 and June 1815. The preliminary conditions already agreed on in Paris were moderate for France to not disturb the re-enthronement of the returned Bourbon king: France's borders of 1 June 1792 were confirmed, and in addition, she was allowed to retain Saarbrücken, Saarlouis, Landau, the County of Montbéliard, part of Savoy with Annecy and Chambéry, also Avignon and the Comtat Venaissin as well as artifacts acquired during the war, while on the other hand she had to cede several colonies
 With this in mind, the territories strengthened themselves for protection
 The only exceptions to this were Tobago, St
 Spain signed later in July
The treaty also reinstated the Bourbon monarchy in France, in the person of Louis XVIII
 These included Guadeloupe, which had been ceded to Sweden by Britain when she entered the coalition
 It established peace between France and the United Kingdom, Russia, Austria, and Prussia, who in March had defined their common war aim in Chaumont, and was also signed by Portugal and Sweden
 Lucia, Seychelles and Mauritius
In addition to the cessation of hostilities, the treaty provided a rough draft of a final settlement, which according to article 32 was to be concluded within the next two months at a congress involving all belligerents of the Napoleonic Wars
The treaty also aimed to abolish the French slave trade, but not slavery, over a five-year period, and formally recognized the independence of Switzerland
Several powers, despite the peaceful intentions of the treaty, still feared a reassertion of French power
" The Constitutional Charter that is referred to so hopefully, was the Constitution of 1791, promulgated under the "Ancien régime" at the outset of the Revolution
 On the same day, in a separate document, Great Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia renewed the Quadruple Alliance
 It reaffirmed the "Declaration of the Powers, on the Abolition of the Slave Trade, of 8th of February 1815" (Which also formed of the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna) and added that the governments of the contracting parties should "without loss of time
It was also agreed that neither the Coalition nor the French troops would occupy (unless for particular reasons and by mutual agreement), the following territories and districts:
On 20 March 1815, at the Congress of Vienna, the European powers (Austria, France, Great Britain, Portugal, Prussia, Russia, Spain and Sweden) agreed to recognise permanently an independent, neutral Switzerland, and on 27 May Switzerland acceded to this declaration
 Four days after France's defeat in the Battle of Waterloo, Napoleon was persuaded to abdicate again, on 22 June
 In the month preceding the commencement of each of these four monthly periods, France was to redeem successively one of these bonds for 46⅔ millions, by exchanging it against the first-mentioned daily assignations payable to bearer, which assignations, for the purpose of convenience and negotiability, were again subdivided into "coupures", or sets of smaller sums
The fourth convention related exclusively to the liquidation of the claims of British subjects on the government of France, in conformity with the Paris peace treaty of 1814, and the Article Eight of the Paris Peace Treaty of 1815. All British subjects who, since 1 January 1791, had suffered loss of property in France, by sequestration or confiscation by the French Government, were to be indemnified
 King Louis XVIII, who had fled the country when Napoleon arrived in Paris, took the throne for a second time on 8 July
 The Quadruple Alliance was reinstated in a separate treaty also signed 20 November 1815, introducing a new concept in European diplomacy, the peacetime congress "for the maintenance of peace in Europe" on the pattern of the Congress of Vienna, which had concluded 9 June 1815.
 Its provisions for the government of France would rapidly fall by the wayside, "notwithstanding the paternal intentions of her King" as the treaty remarks
The convention on pecuniary indemnity regulated the mode of liquidating the indemnity of 700 millions francs to be paid by France, in conformity to the fourth article of the treaty
The treaty was harsher towards France than the Treaty of 1814, which had been negotiated through the manoeuvre of Talleyrand, because of reservations raised by the recent widespread support for Napoleon in France
 The sum was to be paid, day by day, in equal portions, in the space of five years, from 1 December 1815.
Convention on Private Claims upon France
Treaty of Paris (1815)
The claims were to be examined and decided on by a mixed commission of liquidation: and, if their votes were equal, an arbitrator would be chosen by lot from a mixed commission of arbitration
However, during Napoleon's Hundred Days the Seventh Coalition suspended the signing of the Act of Acknowledgement and Guarantee of the perpetual Neutrality of Switzerland until after Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated — this allowed Coalition forces to pass through Swiss territory
 The amount of permanent stock lost was to be inscribed in the "Grand Livre", and to bear interest from 22 March 1816; excepting, however, such holders as had, since 1797, voluntarily submitted to receive their dividends at a third
 As soon as the inscription had been effected, Britain would restore the French colonies as agreed in the treaty of 1814, including the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, provisionally re-occupied by the British troops
Within the line occupied by the Coalition army, 26 fortresses were allowed to have garrisons, but without any materiel or equipment of artillery and engineer stores, as follows:
Indemnification was further granted for the loss of immovable property by sequestration, confiscation, or sale; and particular regulations were laid down for ascertaining its value in the fairest possible manner
The distribution of the sum among the Coalition Powers, agreed to be paid by France in this convention, was regulated by a separate convention, (the "Protocol for the pecuniary indemnity to be furnished by France" and the "Table of allotment"):
 France was ordered to pay 700 million francs in indemnities, and the country's borders were reduced to their 1790 level
 All four treaties were signed on the same day (20 November 1815), had verbatim stipulations, and were styled the same way (for example the "Definitive Treaty between Great Britain and France")
 For this daily quota, the French government had to give assignations on the French treasury, payable to bearer, day by day
France was to supply all the wants of the 150,000 allied troops who remained in the country
 France was to pay additional money to cover the cost of providing additional defensive fortifications to be built by neighbouring Coalition countries
Articles 17, 18, and 19, related to the payment of the claims and their inscription in the "Grand Livre" (general ledger)
 There were twenty-six articles in the convention which:
Treaty of Paris of 1815, was signed on 20 November 1815 following the defeat and second abdication of Napoleon Bonaparte
The Swiss Confederation had been internationally recognised as an independent neutral state at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. During the Napoleonic Wars it failed to remain neutral, as some cantons had been annexed into other states and, under French influence, the Act of Mediation was signed and the Swiss Confederation was replaced by the more centralised Helvetic Republic which was allied to France
The 1815 peace treaties were drawn up entirely in French, the "lingua franca" of contemporary diplomacy
 In addition to having "preserved France and Europe from the convulsions with which they were menaced by the late enterprise of Napoleon Bonaparte," the signers of the Treaty also repudiated "the revolutionary system reproduced in France
 The first Treaty of Paris, of 30 May 1814, and the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna, of 9 June 1815, were confirmed
 [find] the most effectual measures for the entire and definitive abolition of a Commerce so odious, and so strongly condemned by the laws of religion and of nature
Convention on Pecuniary Indemnity
 A liquidation was to take place every six months, when the assignations duly discharged by the French Treasury were to be received as payments to their amount, and the deficiency arising from assignations not honoured would be made good, with interest, at five percent from the fund of interest inscribed in the "Grand Livre", in a manner specified in this convention
 With the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1814, the Cantons of Switzerland started the process of constructing a new, less centralised constitution
Additional Article on the Slave Trade
 France lost the territorial gains of the Revolutionary armies in 1790–92, which the previous treaty had allowed France to keep; the nation was reduced to its 1790 boundaries (plus the enclaves of the Comtat Venaissin and the County of Montbéliard, which France was allowed to keep)
 The territories and fortresses definitively ceded by France, as well as the fortresses to be provisionally occupied by the Coalition troops for five years, were to be given up to them within ten days from the signature of the principal treaty, and all the Coalition forces, except 150,000 which were to remain, were to evacuate France within 21 days from that date
 A separate account was to be kept of arrears that had accrued for all types of property, for which arrears were to be calculated at an interest of four percent per annum
 France was now also ordered to pay 700 million francs in indemnities, in five yearly instalments, and to maintain at its own expense a Coalition army of occupation of 150,000 soldiers in the eastern border territories of France, from the English Channel to the border with Switzerland, for a maximum of five years
Convention on Claims of British Subjects
 The treaty was signed for Great Britain by Lord Castlereagh and the Duke of Wellington and by the duc de Richelieu for France; parallel treaties with France were signed by Austria, Russia, and Prussia, forming in effect the first confederation of Europe
Although some of the Allies, notably Prussia, initially demanded that France cede significant territory in the East, rivalry among the powers and the general desire to secure the Bourbon restoration made the peace settlement less onerous than it might have been
 Lodging, fuel, light, provisions, and forage were to be furnished in kind, to an extent not exceeding 200,000 daily rations for men, and 50,000 daily rations for horses; and for pay, equipment, clothing, &c
Thus, France had to pay on account of this convention, 383,251 francs every day for five years; equal to about 16,000 pounds sterling at the exchange rate of the day
 So with Article 84 of the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna dated 20 November 1815, the four major Coalition powers (Austria, Great Britain, Prussia and Russia) and France gave their formal and authentic acknowledgement of the perpetual neutrality of Switzerland
 In the first instance, however, the Coalition Commissioners were to receive the whole of the 700 million in fifteen bonds of 46⅔ million each; the first of which was payable on 31 March 1816, the second on 21 July 1816, and so on, every fourth month
The 1815 treaty had stronger punitive terms than the treaty of the previous year
 The same was to be the case in regard to former life annuities from the French government
The treaty is presented "in the desire to consolidate, by maintaining inviolate the Royal authority, and by restoring the operation of the Constitutional Charter, the order of things which had been happily re-established in France
Convention on the Military Line
 There were four treaties, between France and each of the four major Seventh Coalition powers: Austria, Great Britain, Prussia and Russia
 The princes and free towns, who were not signatories, were invited to accede to its terms, whereby the treaty became a part of the public law by which Europe, with the exclusion of Ottoman Turkey, established "relations from which a system of real and permanent balance of power in Europe is to be derived
All these claims were to be sent in within a year after the ratification of the treaty or they would be voided (Article 16), and committees for their liquidation were to he appointed
 From this indemnity, however, were excluded ships, cargoes, and other movable property seized in conformity to the laws of war and the prohibitory decrees
 The twofold purpose of the military occupation was rendered self-evident by the convention annexed to the treaty outlining the incremental terms by which France would issue negotiable bonds covering the indemnity: in addition to safeguarding the neighboring states from a revival of revolution in France, it guaranteed fulfilment of the treaty's financial clauses
 As a guarantee for the payment of claims sanctioned under this convention, there was to be inscribed in the "Grand Livre", before 1 January 1816, a capital bearing 3½ millions francs of interest, in the name of a further mixed commission of English and French officers, who were to receive such interest; without, however, disposing of the same otherwise than by placing it in the public funds, at accumulating interest for the benefit of the creditors
Under the terms of the treaty parts of France were to be occupied by up to 150,000 soldiers for five years, with France footing the bill—however the Coalition occupation, under the command Duke of Wellington was only deemed necessary for three years and the foreign troops pulled out in 1818.
 As a guarantee for the regular payment of these assignations, and to provide for deficiencies, France assigned, moreover, to the allies, a fund of interest, to be inscribed in the "Grand Livre" of her public debt, of seven millions francs on a capital of 140 millions
The convention on the military line regulated all matters concerning the temporary occupation of the frontiers of France by a Coalition army of 150,000 men, conforming to
 Estimating the value of the soldier's portion and allowances at 1½ francs, and the cavalry ration at 2 francs, the annual cost of the deliveries in kind for 200,000 portions and 50,000 rations would have been 146 million in francs, which, with the addition of 50 million franc of money per annum, formed a total of 196 million francs per annum, equal to 22,370 sterling per day at the exchange rate of the time
 All claims of the above, or any other description, were to be given in, within three months after the date of the signing fourth convention (20 November 1815) from Europe, six months from the western colonies, and twelve months from the East Indies, &c
In addition to the definitive peace treaty between France and Great Britain, Austria, Prussia and Russia, there were four additional conventions and the act confirming the neutrality of Switzerland signed on the same day
 As a guarantee of payment, the 20th article provided that a capital, bearing 3½ millions of francs in interest, be inscribed in the "Grand Livre", the interest of which is to be received half yearly by joint-commissioners
An additional article appended to the Definitive Peace Treaty, addressed the issue of slavery
 In February, Napoleon had escaped from his exile on Elba; he entered Paris on 20 March, beginning the Hundred Days of his restored rule
 The military line to be occupied, would extend along the frontiers which separated the departments of the Pas de Calais, of the North of the Ardennes, of the Meuse, of the Moselle, of the Lower Rhine, and of the Upper Rhine, from the interior of France
Act on the Neutrality of Switzerland
The convention on private claims upon France assured the payment of money due by France to the subjects of the Coalition powers, in conformity with the treaty of 1814 and to the 8th article of the 1815 peace treaty
 The claims under this convention were immense, so it is totally impossible when the convention was signed for the parties to have a clear idea of the amount
France was to pay to the allies 50 millions francs per annum during the five-year occupation: the allies, however, were content with only 30 million, on account, for the first year
The direct expense entailed upon France by this convention greatly exceed the amount of the indemnity of 700 million
 Movable properly, lost through the above causes, was also to be paid for by inscriptions according to its value, with interest calculated on it at three percent per annum
 These were listed by the British Foreign office as:

 The treaty was signed on December 10, 1898, and ended the Spanish–American War
 In discussions with its advisers, though, the commission concluded that Spain, if it retained part of the Philippines, would be likely to sell that part to another European power and that this would likely be troublesome for America
 Upon Spain's departure from Cuba, it was to be occupied by the United States, and the United States would assume and discharge any obligations that under international law could result from the fact of its occupation

 The United States refused initially to sign the Treaty on the grounds that Russia was not represented at the treaty conference
 The Soviet Union and Japan never recognized this Union
 The treaty, however, never came into force because Japan failed to ratify it
The 1920 Treaty of Paris was an act signed by Romania and the principal Allied Powers of the time (France, United Kingdom, Italy and Japan) whose purpose was the recognition of Romanian sovereignty over Bessarabia
The Paris Peace Treaty of 28 October 1920, formally recognized the union of Bessarabia with Romania
As with the Treaty of Versailles, the 1920 treaty contained the Covenant of the League of Nations, and, as a result, it was not ratified by the United States

 Known collectively as "The Igors", Igor Yatsenko and Igor Ivaniuk had been EIAS's primary software developers for many years
The Electric Image Animation System is not a single program, but rather a suite of several programs designed to work together
 The new company released version 4.0 and 5.0 under the Electric Image moniker
 It currently runs on the OS X and Windows platforms

 Together with Animator and VFX Supervisor Tomas Egger, they will continue development of software applications: Animator, Camera, Renderama and all related modules
 As of this writing, Electric Image recommends for this purpose
When the company later decided to offer their software for sale to others, it quickly gained a customer base that lauded the developers for the software's exceptionally fast rendering engine and high image quality

The exponential function formula_12 satisfies the linear differential equation:
A quantity "x" depends exponentially on time "t" if
 This is revealed to be the 29th day, and then there will be just one day to save the pond
 Although growth may initially be exponential, the modelled phenomena will eventually enter a region in which previously ignored negative feedback factors become significant (leading to a logistic growth model) or other underlying assumptions of the exponential growth model, such as continuity or instantaneous feedback, break down
A popular approximated method for calculating the doubling time from the growth rate is the rule of 70,
 For any fixed "b" not equal to 1 (e
Exponential growth models of physical phenomena only apply within limited regions, as unbounded growth is not physically realistic
French children are told a story in which they imagine having a pond with water lily leaves floating on the surface
Rice on a chessboard
 (From Swirski, 2006)
 Using the notation "t" for the (dimensionless) number of units of time rather than the time itself, "t/p" can be replaced by "t", but for uniformity this has been avoided here
If "τ" > 0 and "b" > 1, then "x" has exponential growth
where "k" = 0 corresponds to "r" = 0 and to τ and "T" being infinite
Exponential growth occurs when the growth rate of the value of a mathematical function is proportional to the function's current value
 "e" or 2), the growth rate is given by the non-zero time "τ"
 For example, if one wishes to empirically estimate the growth rate from intertemporal data on "x", one can linearly regress log "x" on "t"
After one hour, or six ten-minute intervals, there would be sixty-four bacteria
According to an old legend, vizier Sissa Ben Dahir presented an Indian King Sharim with a beautiful, hand-made chessboard
Thus the law of exponential growth can be written in different but mathematically equivalent forms, by using a different base
In the above differential equation, if "k" < 0, then the quantity experiences exponential decay
 The most common forms are the following:
This allows an exponentially growing variable to be modeled with a log-linear model
showing that "x" experiences exponential growth
Growth rates may also be faster than exponential
, 5% larger than) what it was at the previous time
 For any non-zero time "τ" the growth rate is given by the dimensionless positive number "b"
The differential equation is solved by direct integration:
 In the case of a discrete domain of definition with equal intervals, it is also called geometric growth or geometric decay (the function values form a geometric progression)
Limitations of models
There is a whole hierarchy of conceivable growth rates that are slower than exponential and faster than linear (in the long run)
 (From Meadows "et al"
Differential equation
where "x"0 is the value of "x" at time 0. For example, with a growth rate of "r" = 5% = 0.05, going from "any" integer value of time to the next integer causes "x" at the second time to be 1.05 times (i
 Exponential decay occurs in the same way when the growth rate is negative
Reformulation as log-linear growth
 All went well at first, but the requirement for 2 "n" − 1 grains on the "n"th square demanded over a million grains on the 21st square, more than a million million (aka trillion) on the 41st and there simply was not enough rice in the whole world for the final squares
 Since the time variable, which is the input to this function, occurs as the exponent, this is an exponential function; hence the name "exponential growth"
If "p" is the unit of time the quotient "t/p" is simply the number of units of time
 If "τ" < 0 and "b" > 1, or "τ" > 0 and 0 < "b" < 1, then "x" has exponential decay
 Day after day the plant seems small and so it is decided to leave it to grow until it half-covers the pond, before cutting it back
 The king asked what he would like in return for his gift and the courtier surprised the king by asking for one grain of rice on the first square, two grains on the second, four grains on the third etc
Parameters (negative in the case of exponential decay):
Many pairs ("b", "τ") of a dimensionless non-negative number "b" and an amount of time "τ" (a physical quantity which can be expressed as the product of a number of units and a unit of time) represent the same growth rate, with "τ" proportional to log "b"
The quantities "k", τ, and "T", and for a given "p" also "r", have a one-to-one connection given by the following equation (which can be derived by taking the natural logarithm of the above):
 The king readily agreed and asked for the rice to be brought
The difference equation
 In this case the division by "p" in the last formula is not a numerical division either, but converts a dimensionless number to the correct quantity including unit
If a variable "x" exhibits exponential growth according to formula_10, then the log (to any base) of "x" grows linearly over time, as can be seen by taking logarithms of both sides of the exponential growth equation:
The second half of the chessboard is the time when an exponentially growing influence is having a significant economic impact on an organization's overall business strategy
 The lily population doubles in size every day and if left unchecked will smother the pond in 30 days, killing all the other living things in the water
Example: "If a species of bacteria doubles every ten minutes, starting out with only one bacterium, how many bacteria would be present after one hour?" The question implies "a" = 1, "b" = 2 and "τ" = 10 min
where the constant "a" is the initial value of "x",
the constant "b" is a positive growth factor, and "τ" is the time constant—the time required for "x" to increase by one factor of "b":
For a nonlinear variation of this growth model see logistic function
The formula for exponential growth of a variable "x" at the (positive or negative) growth rate "r", as time "t" goes on in discrete intervals (that is, at integer times 0, 1, 2, 3.
In the long run, exponential growth of any kind will overtake linear growth of any kind (the basis of the Malthusian catastrophe) as well as any polynomial growth, i

The Europe Declaration was signed by all the leaders present
 It declared that the Treaty had given birth to Europe
Treaty of Paris (1951)
 Some of the main enemies during the war were now sharing production of coal and steel, the key-resources which previously had been central to the war effort
The Treaty of Paris (formally the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community) was signed on 18 April 1951 between France, West Germany, Italy and the three Benelux countries (Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands), establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which subsequently became part of the European Union
The treaty was seen as producing diplomatic and economic stability in western Europe after the Second World War
 It emphasised that the supranational principle was the foundation of the new democratic organisation of Europe
 The supranational concept was opposed by Charles de Gaulle
 The treaty came into force on 23 July 1952 and expired on 23 July 2002, exactly fifty years after it came into effect
 Then, for reasons unclear, he devoted his time to writing, producing his first novel, "In the Quarter" (written in 1887 in Munich)

 Bleiler described "The King in Yellow" as one of the most important works of American supernatural fiction
 Lovecraft said of Chambers in a letter to Clark Ashton Smith,
Chambers' novel "The Tracer of Lost Persons" was adapted into a long-running (1937–54) old-time radio crime drama, "Mr
His novel "The Man They Hanged" was about Captain Kidd, and argued that Kidd was not a pirate, and had been made a scapegoat by the British government
Chambers returned to the weird genre in his later short story collections "The Maker of Moons", "The Mystery of Choice" and "The Tree of Heaven", but none earned him as much success as "The King in Yellow"
 Some of Chambers's work contains elements of science fiction, such as "In Search of the Unknown" and "Police!!!", about a zoologist who encounters monsters
 After 1924 he devoted himself solely to writing historical fiction
He was born in Brooklyn, New York, to William P
 According to some estimates, Chambers had one of the most successful literary careers of his period, his later novels selling well and a handful achieving best-seller status
Critical studies of Chambers's horror and fantasy work include Lee Weinstein's
Robert was first educated at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, and then entered the Art Students' League at around the age of twenty, where the artist Charles Dana Gibson was his fellow student
On July 12, 1898, he married Elsa Vaughn Moller (1882–1939)
 Some of his novels touch upon colonial life in Broadalbin and Johnstown
 Chambers studied at the École des Beaux-Arts, and at Académie Julian, in Paris from 1886 to 1893, and his work was displayed at the Salon as early as 1889. On his return to New York, he succeeded in selling his illustrations to "Life", "Truth", and "Vogue" magazines
Despite Chambers' effective later abandonment of the weird supernatural tale, these early works are all that remained in print through most of the twentieth century, thanks to Lovecraft's inclusion of them in the critical study Supernatural Horror in Literature

Typologically, lamps of the Ancient Mediterranean can be divided into seven major categories:
 The oil lamp and its light were important household items, and this may explain their symbolism
That darkness of the soul is chased by Light (of the Lord),
The first manufactured red pottery oil lamps appeared
Lamps were simple wheel-made bowls with a slight pinch on four sides for the wick
Oil lamps also became proverbial

 Five of the bridesmaids were foolish, and five were wise
 All lamps are closed in type
’ So always be ready
 For example, a Bradj (pre-Hindi) proverb says, "Chiraag tale andhera", "the [utmost] darkness is under the oil-lamp (chiraag)", meaning that what you seek could be close but unnoticed (right under your nose or feet), in various senses (and indeed, a lamp's container casts a strong shadow)
The four-wick oil lamps persist into this period, most of the lamps now have one wick
 These were of the round bowl type
 Then the door was closed and locked
 The nozzle is elongated
 These lamps are made from large bowls with four shallow pinches for wicks
Earlier lamps were made out of stone or seashells
They are round in shape, wheel-made
 Orthodox Christians will also use oil lamps in their homes to illuminate their icon corner
 Such lamps are usually made from clear glass (they look similar to normal drinking glasses) and are filled with oil, sometimes with water underneath
 The shoulder is wider and the discus is smaller with fewer decorations
 Pierced lugs occurred briefly between 4th and 3rd century BCE
 The use of oil lamps began thousands of years ago and is continued to this day, although not commonly anymore
 (Mesolithic, Middle Stone Age Period, circa 10,300 - 8000 BC) The oldest stone-oil lamp was found in Lascaux in 1940 in a cave that was inhabited 10,000 to 15,000 years ago
 Unpierced lugs continued until the 1st century BCE
 In many houses, the lamp burns all day, but in other homes, it is lit at sundown

 They believe that the alabaster shell-shaped lamps dug up in Sumerian sites dating 2,600 BC were imitations of real shell-lamps that were used for a long time
It is generally agreed that the evolution of handmade lamps moved from bowl-shaped to saucer-shaped, then from saucer with a nozzle, to a closed bowl with a spout
In vedic times, fire was kept alive in every household in some form and carried with oneself while migrating to new locations

 With the motif of a frog or its abstraction, and sometimes with geometrical motifs
 In some of the South Indian temples, raised lamp towers called Kamba Vilakku made of brass can be seen
 The rim is folded over to make the nozzle, so it overlaps and is then pinched to make the wick hole
Most modern lamps (such as fueled lanterns) have been replaced by gas-based or petroleum-based fuels to operate when emergency non-electric light is required
 They are characterized by simple, little or no decoration, and a wide pour hole, a lack of handles, and a pierced or unpierced lug
In this period we find the frog type lamps
Traditionally, the sanctuary lamp in an Orthodox church is an oil lamp
With the four wick lamps
 During marriages, spinsters of the household stand behind the bride and groom, holding an oil lamp to ward off evil
 These in turn were replaced by the kerosene lamp in about 1850. In small towns and rural areas the latter continued in use well into the 20th century, until such areas were finally electrified and light bulbs could be used
 This reverence for the deep is based on the symbolism of the journey from darkness and ignorance to light and the knowledge of the ultimate reality – "tamaso ma jyotirgamaya"

 The frog (Heqet) is an Egyptian fertility symbol
There are several references to oil lamps in the New Testament:
 For lighting multiple lamps, wooden and stone deepastambhas (towers of light) were created
 Miraculously, however, the oil expected to last for only one day burnt for eight full days instead
Decorations include vine scrolls, palm wreaths, and Greek letters
Such lamps are kept burning in shrines, whether private or public, and incense sticks or joss sticks are lit from the lamp
The earliest lamps known from Intermediate Bronze Age lamps (EBIV/MBI)
 Generally the lamps used in temples are circular with places for five wicks
In the later Iron Age, we encounter variant forms
 The lamp is produced in two parts, the upper part with the spout and the lower part with the fuel chamber
 While fire was often described as being destructive, light was given a positive spiritual meaning
 Some believe that the first proper lamps were carved from stones
Erecting a deepastambha in front of a temple is still a general practice in western and southern India
Lamps appear in the Torah and other Jewish sources as a symbol of “lighting” the way for the righteous, the wise, and for love and other positive values
 Over the years various rituals and customs were woven around an oil lamp
 As the name suggests, it is a metal lamp container with aesthetically curvi-linear lines branching out from the base each holding a lamp
 A cork or plastic floater containing a wick is placed on top of the oil with the bottom of the wick submerged in the oil
 In the North of India, a five-wick lamp is used, usually fueled with ghee
Lamps can be categorized based on different criteria, including material (clay, silver, bronze, gold, stone, slip), shape, structure, design, and imagery (e
 This is partly because it is difficult to draw a line detailing when the primitive forms of creating a continuous source of light from fire can be termed a lamp
The Temple Menorah, a ritual seven-branched oil lamp used in the Second Temple, forms the centre of the Chanukah story and centers on the story of the  miracle of the oil: During the cleansing of the Second Temple in Jerusalem after its looting, the lamp was supposed to burn continuously, forever, but there was only oil enough for one day, and no more oil would be available for eight days
The first lamps were made of naturally occurring objects, coconuts, sea shells, egg shells and hollow stones
 (Neolithic, Later Stone Age, c
There is a transition period from Byzantine to Islamic lamps
 Another type is a small, shallow bowl with a thick and high discus base
 Later lamps had only one pinch
 They have a wide discus, a narrow shoulder and no handle, elaborate imagery and artistic finishing, and a wide range of patterns of decoration
 They said, ‘Sir, sir! Open the door to let us in
 Lamps of this transition period changed from being decorated with crosses, animals, human likenesses, birds, fish, etc
 Lands were donated to or conquered for the temple for this sole objective
An oil lamp is an object used to produce light continuously for a period of time using an oil-based fuel source
 In addition, other forms evolve, such as small lamps with a flat base and larger lamps with a round base
’ But the bridegroom answered, ‘Certainly not! I don’t even know you
 The parable of His light is, as it were, that of a niche containing a lamp; the lamp is [enclosed] in glass, the glass [shining] like a radiant star: [a lamp] lit from a blessed tree - an olive-tree that is neither of the east nor of the west the oil whereof [is so bright that it] would well-nigh give light [of itself] even though fire had not touched it: light upon light! God guides unto His light him that wills [to be guided]; and [to this end] God propounds parables unto men, since God [alone] has full knowledge of all things"
 One common type is small, with a wide rim and a wide base
Lamp typological categories
A more pronounced, deeper single spout is developed, and it is almost closed on the sides
 The sign of the cross is often made with soot from this flame on the lintel above the home's main door, and the flame is transferred to the icon corner oil lamp; only then can the "lampáda" be extinguished
 There is usually a piece of metal that forms the back of the lamp, which has a picture of a Hindu deity embossed on it
In South India, there are a few types of oil lamps that are common in temples and traditional rituals, some of the smaller ones are used for offerings as well:a
 The vast majority were stamped on the bottom to identify the manufacturer
 The later form continues into the Iron Age II
The first kerosene lamp was described by al-Razi (Rhazes) in 9th-century Baghdad, who referred to it as the "naffatah" in his "Kitab al-Asrar" ("Book of Secrets")
 They were produced between the 3rd to 9th centuries CE
The oil lamp and its light also became important ritualistic articles with the further development of Jewish culture and its religion
 The tip of the spout is more upright in contrast to the rest of the rim
 Their decoration is either non-religious, Christian or Jewish
 They took their lamps with them
 The foolish bridesmaids took their lamps with them, but they did not take extra oil for the lamps
 Later they were replaced by earthen and metal lamps
In the Orthodox Church and many Eastern Catholic Churches oil lamps (, Slavonic: "lampada") are still used both on the Holy Table (altar) and to illuminate icons on the iconostasis and around the temple (church building)
 These lamps have handles and short plain nozzles, and less artistic finishing
The following are the main external parts of a terra-cotta lamp:
By strength of faith
The rim becomes wider and flatter with a deeper and higher spout
 Moreover, a day is kept aside for the worship of the lamp in the busy festival calendar, on one amavasya (no moon) day in the month of Shravan
 All lamps are now wheel-made
 Produced locally or imported in large scale
 The multiple nozzles continue
A hand-held oil lamp or incense sticks (lit from the lamp) are also used during the Hindu puja ceremony
Chinese folk religion
 Curved stone lamps were found in places dated to the 10th millennium BC
 The largest oil lamp excavated so far is one discovered in a 4th-century tomb located in modern Pingshan, Hebei
 Usually only one wick is lit, with all five burning only on festive occasions
 We still find lamps similar to the Late Bronze period
 For adapting the design to households and smaller spaces, the deepavriksha (tree of light) was formed
 Then they became entirely geometric or linear with raised dots
 Who will, may have this Light;
Factory lamps: Also called "Firmalampen" (from German), these are universal in distribution and simple in appearance
 Lamps produced in large scale in factories
 The "lampáda" is lit at midnight, with the holy light from the priest's candle, and then carried home
 Kuthuvilakku is another typical lamp traditionally used for household purposes in South India
 Early in this period the pinch is shallow, while later on it becomes more prominent and the mouth protrudes from the lamp's body
 Most are of the characteristic Imperial Type
Production of oil-lamps shifted to Italy as the main source of supply
 The simple shape evolved and the lamps were created in the shapes of the matsya (fish), kurma (Tortoise) and other incarnations of god Vishnu and also in the shape of the many emblems of gods like conch shells, lotuses and so on
Oil lamps are commonly used in Hindu temples as well as in home shrines
 The oil burned in all of these lamps is traditionally olive oil
 Initially made in factories in Northern Italy and Southern Gaul between the 1st and 3rd centuries CE, they were exported to all Roman provinces
 They made their lamps ready
 The oil in our lamps is all gone
The earliest Chinese oil lamps are dated from the Warring States period (481-221 BC)
The High Imperial Type
 Oil lamps were used for many spiritual rituals
 Some are with a lug, pierced and not pierced
 As such, oil lamps of today are primarily used for the particular ambience they produce, or in rituals and religious ceremonies
 The oil lamp is used in the Hindu ritual of Aarti
 The birds like swans, peacocks, parrots and animals like snakes, lions, elephants and horses were also favorites when decorating a lamp
 Later, the other bridesmaids came

 His operas include "English Eccentrics", to a libretto by Edith Sitwell; "Our Man in Havana", after Graham Greene's novel; "The Violins of Saint Jacques", from Patrick Leigh Fermor's novel, featuring a volcanic eruption that kills all but one of the principal characters; and "Lucky Peter's Journey" and "The Growing Castle", both of which set plays by August Strindberg
Williamson married Dolores Daniel in 1960 and had one son and two daughters
 Williamson's music for children includes the operas "The Happy Prince" (based on the story by Oscar Wilde) and "Julius Caesar Jones" as well as "cassations", which are short operas with audience participation
Williamson wrote seven symphonies; four numbered piano concertos (plus the Concerto for Two Pianos and Strings, the Concerto for Two Pianos and Wind Quintet, after Alan Rawsthorne, and the Sinfonia Concertante), concertos for violin, organ, harp and saxophone; and many other orchestral works
Some of Williamson's early works use the twelve tone technique of Arnold Schoenberg, but his greatest influence is often said to be Olivier Messiaen
 Williamson was also inspired to respond through music to political issues, such as Aboriginal rights (a matter close to his heart)
 He died in 2003 in a hospital in Cambridge
 He wrote ballets, including "Sun into Darkness" and "The Display", many effective choral works, chamber music, music for solo piano, and music for film and television including the Prologue and Main Title of "Watership Down"
Although Williamson lived in Britain for most of his life, he travelled widely and maintained a deep affection for his native country
 The orchestral song cycle on texts by Iris Murdoch, "A Year of Birds", premiered at The Proms in 1995. The same year also saw the premiere of an orchestral work "With Proud Thanksgiving", commissioned for the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, and dedicated to the memory of Williamson's long-time friend, the UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson
 He wrote many works specifically for or about Australia, and frequently set texts by Australian poets, such as James McAuley and Kath Walker

 He was widely reported to have been an alcoholic
 Scored for two sopranos, tenor, baritone; soprano, alto, tenor, bass (henceforth SATB) chorus; SATB echo choir; and large orchestra, the work received several performances over a few years, including a live BBC broadcast in 1981, but has more recently been overlooked
 He discovered Messiaen's music shortly before converting to Roman Catholicism in 1952. He was also influenced by Benjamin Britten, as well as by jazz and popular music (this latter influence may have come in part from him working as a night club pianist in the 1950s)

In 1975, the death of Sir Arthur Bliss left the title of Master of the Queen's Music vacant
 However, controversy attended his tenure, notably his failure to complete the intended "Jubilee Symphony" for the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 1977. He became less prolific in "Royal" works during the last twenty years or so of his life, although he never completely ceased to take interest in writing music for the Royal Family (see list of "Royal Works" below)
 It is not clear why Williamson did not qualify for a substantive award, as there appears to be nothing on the public record to suggest he ever relinquished his Australian citizenship

 He wrote a number of pieces connected to his royal post, including "Mass of Christ the King" (1978) (see below) and "Lament in Memory of Lord Mountbatten of Burma" (1980)
 Other works include the "Requiem for a Tribe Brother" (another Australian work, completed in 1992), a third string quartet (1993), a fourth piano concerto (1994, for Marguerite Wolff) and a symphony for solo harp, "Day That I Have Loved" (1994)

 These developments will affect future evolution, and may require new principles that address life at its core, such as biotic ethics that values life itself at its basic biological processes and structures, and seeks their propagation
 In 1970, the American biochemist Van Rensselaer Potter also used the term with a broader meaning including solidarity towards the biosphere, thus generating a "global ethics," a discipline representing a link between biology, ecology, medicine and human values in order to attain the survival of both human beings and other animal species
One of the first areas addressed by modern bioethicists was that of human experimentation
 In Africa, and partly also in Latin America, the debate on bioethics frequently focuses on its practical relevance in the context of underdevelopment and geopolitical power relations

Bioethicists come from a wide variety of backgrounds and have training in a diverse array of disciplines
 Professional level versions of these organizations also exist
 In the case of many non-Western cultures, a strict separation of religion from philosophy does not exist
The term "Bioethics" (Greek "bios", life; "ethos", behavior) was coined in 1926 by Fritz Jahr, who "anticipated many of the arguments and discussions now current in biological research involving animals" in an article about the "bioethical imperative," as he called it, regarding the scientific use of animals and plants
 Bioethics has also benefited from the process philosophy developed by Alfred North Whitehead
Perspectives and methodology
 In many Asian cultures, for example, there is a lively discussion on bioethical issues
 Others have added non-maleficence, human dignity and the sanctity of life to this list of cardinal values
 The field contains individuals trained in philosophy such as H
 Bioethicists often disagree among themselves over the precise limits of their discipline, debating whether the field should concern itself with the ethical evaluation of all questions involving biology and medicine, or only a subset of these questions
 Medical ethics shares many principles with other branches of healthcare ethics, such as nursing ethics
 Leading journals in the field include The "Journal of Medicine and Philosophy", The "Hastings Center Report", the "American Journal of Bioethics", the "Journal of Medical Ethics" and the "Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics"
 A bioethicist assists the health care and research community in examining moral issues involved in our understanding of life and death, and resolving ethical dilemmas in medicine and science
Medical ethics is the study of moral values and judgments as they apply to medicine
 It is also moral discernment as it relates to medical policy, practice, and research
Bioethics is the study of the typically controversial ethical issues emerging from new situations and possibilities brought about by advances in biology and medicine
 Numerous discussion based bioethics groups exist in universities across the United States to champion exactly such goals
 Still, the two fields often overlap and the distinction is more a matter of style than professional consensus
 Others would broaden the scope of ethical evaluation to include the morality of all actions that might help or harm organisms capable of feeling fear
The field of bioethics has addressed a broad swathe of human inquiry, ranging from debates over the boundaries of life (e
 organ donation, health care rationing) to the right to refuse medical care for religious or cultural reasons
 Buddhist bioethics, in general, is characterised by a naturalistic outlook that leads to a rationalistic, pragmatic approach
Areas of health sciences that are the subject of published, peer-reviewed bioethical analysis include:
 of Rice University, Baruch Brody of Rice University, Peter Singer of Princeton University, Daniel Callahan of the Hastings Center, and Daniel Brock of Harvard University, medically trained clinician ethicists such as Mark Siegler of the University of Chicago and Joseph Fins of Cornell University, lawyers such as Nancy Dubler of Albert Einstein College of Medicine or Jerry Menikoff of the federal Office of Human Research Protections, political scientists like Francis Fukuyama, religious studies scholars including James Childress, public intellectuals like Amitai Etzioni of The George Washington University, and theologians like Lisa Sowle Cahill and Stanley Hauerwas
 It also includes the study of the more commonplace questions of values ("the ethics of the ordinary") which arise in primary care and other branches of medicine
 The Jewish, Christian and
 Bioethicists are concerned with the ethical questions that arise in the relationships among life sciences, biotechnology, medicine, politics, law, and philosophy
 In India, Vandana Shiva is a leading bioethicist speaking from the Hindu tradition
Another important principle of bioethics is its placement of value on discussion and presentation
Many religious communities have their own histories of inquiry into bioethical issues and have developed rules and guidelines on how to deal with these issues from within the viewpoint of their respective faiths
Muslim faiths have each developed a considerable body of literature on these matters
 The field, once dominated by formally trained philosophers, has become increasingly interdisciplinary, with some critics even claiming that the methods of analytic philosophy have had a negative effect on the field's development
 Buddhist bioethicists include Damien Keown
The scope of bioethics can expand with biotechnology, including cloning, gene therapy, life extension, human genetic engineering, astroethics and life in space, and manipulation of basic biology through altered DNA, XNA and proteins
 Some bioethicists would narrow ethical evaluation only to the morality of medical treatments or technological innovations, and the timing of medical treatment of humans
 The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research was initially established in 1974 to identify the basic ethical principles that should underlie the conduct of biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects
 Examples include the Ohio State Bioethics Society and the Bioethics Society of Cornell
Medical ethics tends to be understood narrowly as an applied professional ethics, whereas bioethics appears to have worked more expansive concerns, touching upon the philosophy of science and issues of biotechnology
 However, the fundamental principles announced in the Belmont Report (1979)—namely, autonomy, beneficence and justice—have influenced the thinking of bioethicists across a wide range of issues
 As a scholarly discipline, medical ethics encompasses its practical application in clinical settings as well as work on its history, philosophy, theology, and sociology
